# ABYSSAL

Welcome to Abyssal, a universe where space is the final frontier and the
stage for your strangest findings and darkest fears. In this world,
humanity has extended its reach into the cosmos, driven by the
unyielding influence of mega-corporations that now put the traditional
national powers in their shadow. This expansion has been bought with
hard toil and blood, and the cost is rising.

Abyssal fuses the stark reality of a sci-fi universe with deep,
unnerving terror. The vast expanse of space harbours not just wonder,
but also horrifying things that defy human comprehension: scientific
experiments crossing the boundaries of morality, grotesque alien
lifeforms, and eerie practices dabbling in the new emerging occult. It
is a universe of stark contrasts, where the marvels of technological
advancement collide with the primal fear of the unknown.

This Core Rulebook provides everything you need to traverse the shadows
of Abyssal. It includes detailed descriptions of the world, the gritty
realism of void combat, the various character archetypes struggling for
their existence, and the eerie revelations of the dark and hidden, far
away from the awareness of the blissfully ignorant.

Embark on a journey through the stars, where your choices will influence
your adventures in this dark, unforgiving universe. Whether you are a
Suit crafting intricate narratives or a player endeavouring to survive
in this harsh reality, Abyssal offers a deeply immersive experience. It
will test your resolve, your ethics, and your fortitude.

Welcome to Abyssal. Your journey into the darkness is just beginning.

# Why should I play Abyssal?

Abyssal is a game about a tight-knit group of covert operatives working
in corporate espionage. Armed with a spaceship and high-tech equipment,
they work on their mission while maintaining their personal lives and
sanity. It is about morality and decision-making, about discovering that
the Corps has much more to hide than they already know. It is about the
exploration of unknown planets and life forms. It is about the dawn of a
new darkness that threatens to consume the very souls of humanity. Can
the team forge their own path through this maelstrom of danger? Grab
your gear, Wheels in 10

# What is a Roleplaying Game

The closest analogy to a tabletop role-playing game is that of a
theatre. Imagine you are an actor on the scene impersonating a character
in the play and fulfilling its role, quirks, and ambitions. In a theatre
play, the story is fixed, you read it, you learn it, and you act it by
script. This is where a tabletop role-playing game is very different.
Yes, you enact a character that you have generated, as do the other
players. You together form a crew, you are the protagonists of the
story. But the story itself is not fixed. It is more of a frame for the
stories that you and the Suit tell together. The story reacts to your
actions, it adapts and is revealed by you following the flow of it.

So, we know who and what the players are, but who is the Suit? The Suit
is the one that has prepared the story frame, he knows what dangers are
afoot and waiting for the players. The Suit is the eyes and ears of the
players in the world of Abyssal, he plays every person in the world who
is not the players characters, he determines how the world reacts to the
players and their actions. Broken down to the shortest answer, the Suit
describes a scene with all the people, sounds, and visuals that the
characters can perceive. Then the players state their intent and course
of action. The Suit reacts to these actions and describes the changes.
This interaction carries on until the mission comes to its conclusion or
the hour has become late and a break until the next session is in order.

# Setting Overview of Abyssal

## The Universe of Abyssal

The future of humanity is an interstellar journey marked by awe and
terror. Humanity has reached out into the cosmos, establishing its
presence across star systems. This expansion, driven by colossal
corporations, unfolds on a backdrop of advanced technology and
existential threats.

## Corporate Dominance

The era of nation-states has passed. Now, mega-corporations, entities
with resources and power rivalling and surpassing old-world nations,
dominate the landscape. These corporations are the new rulers,
controlling vast territories across space and holding sway over the
lives of billions. Their influence penetrates every aspect of human
life, from governance and economics to military might and scientific
research.

## Interstellar Travel

The lifeline of this expansive universe is the stellar projector
technology, enabling ships to traverse the vast distances of space.
These stellar projectors, ranging from massive, stationary structures to
smaller, ship-mounted versions, are marvels of human ingenuity, albeit
not without their risks and mysteries. They have expanded humanity\'s
spread through the galaxy over the distance of 500 Lightyears around the
cradle of mankind, the Sol system.

## A Universe of Contrasts

It is a universe of contrasts --- a blend of the industrial and the
futuristic, the known and the unknown. While humanity has made
remarkable strides in technology, it stands alone as the only known
intelligent species in a vast and often hostile universe. This isolation
adds a layer of existential dread to the already perilous journey
through space.

## The Horror Within

Beneath the technological marvels and corporate intrigue lies a layer of
horror. The universe is rife with the loss of morals, the creation of
abominations in the name of science, and encounters with ghastly alien
life forms. Fringe occult practices, once thought mere superstition,
yield disturbingly tangible results, adding a layer of cosmic horror to
the already dark tapestry.

Every star could harbour a nightmare, and every jump through the cosmos
is a leap into the unknown. It is a universe where the greatest dangers
frequently come not from the cold void of space, but from the very human
souls that inhabit it.

# An Overview of Its Corporate-Dominated Galaxy

The path to this corporate-dominated era began with significant
advancements in fusion technology, especially with the creation and
evolution of the \"Sparc\" Reactor. This innovation enabled sustainable,
long-term space travel, propelling humanity to spread throughout the
solar system by providing almost unlimited energy. Corporations like
Rayburn-Lark and AdAstra, pioneers in energy systems and asteroid
mining, became key players in shaping this new frontier. As Earth\'s
resources dwindled, these corporations leveraged the abundant raw
materials in space to grow in power and influence.

The Stellar Projector, a major innovation in interstellar travel, marked
humanity\'s expansion beyond the solar system. Led by corporations such
as Quantum Nova and Orbital Dynamics Inc., this technology opened the
galaxy to exploration and colonization. The subsequent period saw the
establishment of extraterrestrial colonies and outposts, with the Zenith
Habitation Corp. leading in terraforming and habitat construction.

## Corporate Sovereignty and the Decline of Nation-States

These corporations, amassing wealth and resources, began to challenge
the authority of Earth\'s governments. Their galactic expansion,
combined with the immense costs and logistics, led to the emergence of
corporate sovereignty. Traditional nation-states, struggling with
internal and environmental crises, became increasingly sidelined.
Corporations, now controlling territories across multiple star systems,
effectively turned into sovereign entities, setting laws, culture, and
social structures within weakening nation-states.

## The Dark Underbelly of a Corporate Galaxy

Despite its technological wonders, the Abyssal universe is far from a
utopia. Capitalism dominates, often neglecting ethics and humanity.
Wealth is synonymous with power and influence. The lower tiers of
society, including workers and mid-level managers, are trapped in a
system favouring the wealthy.

Industrial espionage, a common strategy for corporate survival and
dominance, is a very common strategy. On a smaller scale, the corps do
not even refrain from violence, assassination, and sabotage being the
norm.

## The Role of Media and Cultural Influence

Public opinion is shaped by whoever is controlling the media. This old
wisdom also stands in the times of galactic expansion. All the corps try
to influence and shape the will of the masses towards their ends. This
can be felt in grain in the media world, be it games, ads or news. There
are channels fighting for truth and moral right, but their fight seems
to be a fruitless one.

## The Current State of Affairs

The \"Big 12\" corporations, along with numerous subsidiaries in various
sectors, govern the socio-economic landscape. Their interactions,
ranging from alliances to rivalries, shape the political and cultural
milieu of this space-faring society. Earth, humanity\'s birthplace, now
stands as a cultural relic, its political relevance eclipsed by the
myriad of corporate-governed planets throughout the galaxy.

                                      to the first armed conflict beyond
                                      Earth\'s atmosphere. This conflict
                                      underscores the strategic importance of
                                      off-world resources and sets a precedent
                                      for future space-based territorial

                                      propels humanity into a new age of solar
                                      system colonization, driving both
                                      cooperation and competition among emerging

  Projector                           vast distances in space, marking the
  Technologie                         beginning of true interstellar exploration
                                      and colonization. This technological leap
                                      forward comes with its set of challenges,
                                      including navigation hazards, unforeseen
                                      environmental impacts, and the ethical
                                      implications of terraforming.

                                      reach for the stars. These conflicts are
                                      characterized by a mix of conventional
                                      warfare, proxy battles, and diplomatic
                                      intrigue.

                                      signed aboard the newly established Phobos
                                      Conference Station, restricts the use of a
                                      vital group of Stellar Projectors to
                                      neutral status and establishes a joint
                                      human oversight body. This accord is
                                      crucial for maintaining the cohesion of
                                      the human race in the face of unrest and
                                      war.

  Secession Wars  2275      2312      The Secession Wars between the Sol

                                      Colonies unfold, driven by disputes over
                                      self-governance, taxation, and corporate
                                      influence. These wars are brutal and leave
                                      lasting scars on the interstellar
                                      community, ultimately reshaping the
                                      political landscape of human space.

  Cold War btw.   2310-01   2332-05   The Cold War between the Void Confederacy
  VC and Haven                        and Haven underscores the strategic
                                      importance of stellar projector nodes and
                                      the delicate balance of power in known
                                      space. This period is marked by espionage,
                                      proxy conflicts, and a tense arms race,
                                      highlighting the ever-present threat of
                                      full-scale war.

  The Concordia   2332-05   2332-06   The Concordia treaties bring an end to the
  treaties                            major conflicts in human territory. Though
                                      the Secession wars had gone cold 19 years
                                      ago and the Cold War never got hot the
                                      time for brittle peace had come. To
                                      further the expansion and well-being of
                                      humankind there was an acknowledgement of
                                      existing territories, a renewal of the
                                      Phobos Accord and a clarification of
                                      nation and corporate rights.

  The great       2345      2451      The Great Stagnation brings economic
  Stagnation                          recession and technological plateaus,
                                      leading to social unrest and a series of
                                      revolts against corporate governance. This
                                      period prompts a reevaluation of
                                      humanity\'s priorities and a renewed focus
                                      on sustainable development, cooperation,
                                      and the pursuit of knowledge.

  Establishment   2401      2451      Establishment of Haven. Colonists and
  of Haven                            explorers seeking freedom from both the SP
                                      and USC created Haven, a loosely aligned
                                      federation of colonies emphasizing freedom
                                      and exploration.

  Formation of    2451      2501      Rise of the New Frontier Alliance (NFA)
  the NFA and the                     and Void Confederacy (VC). The NFA emerges
  VC                                  as a wild frontier of opportunity and
                                      danger, while the VC solidifies its power
                                      through autocratic rule and a
                                      controversial deal with mega-corporations.

  Upheaval of the 2499      2534      The year 2499 marked the rise of the Orion
  Orion Syndicate                     Syndicate, a revolutionary group that
                                      began as a coalition of oppressed miners
                                      and workers across several systems. Their
                                      campaign against corporate exploitation
                                      and for worker rights led to the
                                      starvation and death of many
                                      revolutionaries and their families. The
                                      corps made an example by withdrawing
                                      support and suppressing upheaval by force

  Solar           2574      2641      The SP imposes heavy trade sanctions on
  Protectorate                        the USC, citing security concerns over
  trade embargo                       technological exports that could
                                      potentially alter the balance of power.
                                      This move significantly disrupts USC\'s
                                      economy, which relies heavily on
                                      interstellar trade.

  Border          2580      2624-02   A series of unauthorized border incursions
  Incursions                          by SP military vessels into USC space is
                                      reported. SP claims these incursions are
                                      in pursuit of pirates operating within
                                      their territory.

  Diplomatic      2603      \-        High-level diplomatic talks aimed at
  Breakdown                           de-escalating tensions break down, with
  between SP and                      both sides walking out of the
  USC                                 negotiations. Propaganda campaigns
                                      intensify, painting the other side as the
                                      aggressor and a threat to galactic
                                      stability.

  Proxy Wars      2617      2660      Both the SP and USC begin to engage in
                                      proxy wars, supporting opposing factions
                                      in border systems. These conflicts are
                                      officially denied but are an open secret.

  Minor           2634      \-        Skirmishes and proxy wars over
  Territorial                         resource-rich systems occur, though they
  Conflicts                           rarely escalate into full-scale wars due
                                      to the balance of power.

  Arms Race       2634      \-        An arms race between the SP and USC
                                      reaches new heights, with both sides
                                      unveiling next-generation warships and
                                      weapons systems, some of which are powered
                                      by experimental technologies.\
                                      The galactic community expresses concern
                                      over the potential for catastrophic
                                      conflict, but internal pressures and fear
                                      of appearing weak prevent either side from
                                      backing down.

  Stellar         2639      2640      In 2639 two major Stellar Projectors
  Projector                           detonated in a massive wave of
  Crisis                              destruction, far beyond even the wildest
                                      calculations. No other accident has caused
                                      such a desaster befor or afterwards. The
                                      sensor fragments that survived the blasts
                                      just give incohesive data and have not
                                      been analyzed to their full extent. The
                                      source of the destruction is unknown, two
                                      projectors at the same time hint at a
                                      deliberate action. Up to today, no one has
                                      been able to plot a jump to these systems
                                      without ending up wildly of course.

  Rise of         2640      \-        Unrecognized by the general human populace
  Darkness                            across the star systems, unexplainable
                                      events and sightings regarding the occult
                                      begin to manifest. Dabblers in the occult
                                      and other practitioners have successes
                                      with their spells and rituals, even the
                                      ones dating back to ancient times of the
                                      earth.

  VC Rebellion    2641      2660      Widespread uprising against the autocratic
                                      rule of the VC Governing Council leads to
                                      civil unrest and violent clashes. The VC
                                      accuse the USC and Haven of aiding the
                                      rebels. Many people disappear and are
                                      never seen again. In the end, the VC had
                                      to make some reforms to appease the
                                      population. Many paid for this with their
                                      blood.

  Phantasms       2641      2641      A mysterious affliction sweeps through
                                      several space stations, causing
                                      hallucinations of shadowy figures and
                                      voices from nowhere. Despite extensive
                                      research, the source remains unexplained,
                                      fueling theories about a psychic
                                      contagion.

  Hyperion Crisis 2645      2647      A covert operation by a conglomerate of
                                      mega-corporations to seize control of the
                                      Hyperion Gate, a critical chokepoint for
                                      interstellar travel, is exposed. The
                                      ensuing scandal leads to a major shake-up
                                      in corporate leadership and a call for
                                      stricter regulations on corporate
                                      activities in space. This is prevented in
                                      the greater interest of the Corporations.

  Vega Incident   2652      2652      A USC exploration fleet is destroyed near
                                      the Vega system, with USC blaming a covert
                                      SP attack. SP denies involvement,
                                      suggesting an unknown third party or a
                                      navigational error. This incident
                                      galvanizes public support in the USC for a
                                      stronger military response, pushing both
                                      sides closer to open conflict.

  Ultimatum on    2668      2668      SP issues an ultimatum to the USC,
  Vega Incident                       demanding the extradition of several
                                      high-ranking military officials it accuses
                                      of orchestrating the Vega incident and
                                      other acts of aggression. USC rejects the
                                      ultimatum, viewing it as a violation of
                                      its sovereignty and an act of war. Both
                                      sides begin mobilizing their forces in
                                      preparation for a large-scale conflict.

  Encounter at    2670      2670      Impact: USC rejects the ultimatum, viewing
  Zeta Reticuli                       it as a violation of its sovereignty and
                                      an act of war. Both sides begin mobilizing
                                      their forces in preparation for a
                                      large-scale conflict.

  The Nightfall   2671      2671      An exploratory vessel encounters an
  Anomaly                             anomaly in space that absorbs all light,
                                      dubbed the Nightfall Anomaly. Crew members
                                      report feeling an overwhelming sense of
                                      despair and sighting apparitions before
                                      the anomaly disappears as mysteriously as
                                      it appeared. There is nothing that
                                      associates it with a black hole.

  Escalation to   2674      \-        Small-scale skirmishes between SP and USC
  War                                 forces become increasingly common, with
                                      both sides engaging in aggressive
                                      posturing and brinkmanship. A full-scale
                                      war seems imminent, with galactic
                                      observers and minor factions bracing for
                                      the outbreak of hostilities that could
                                      engulf the galaxy.

The year of 2639 heralded one of the most catastrophic events in the
history of mankind. On the 4th of April, the projector of Beminum Leo
started to malfunction. It started into a cataclysmic cycle that
ultimately led to the violent destruction of the large stellar
projector, taking the rest of the system with it. Only a day later, the
projector of HIP 2091 fell into the same cycle. The outcome was equally
destructive. Numerous vessels were still able to escape the ultimate
destruction, capturing lots and lots of sensor data, even telemetry of
the projectors themselves. Up to this date, the final source of the
destruction is not finally determined with rumours running wild.

The destruction of the Beminum Generator was attributed to a
catastrophic malfunction, ruled out immediately with the destruction of
the HIP 2091 Generator. It is widely believed to be a terrorist attack
by a fringe group called "Lone Stars". They were convinced the universe
was not to be conquered by the blight of mankind and made a point by
committing genocide on a massive scale. There was even a public
statement by the group claiming the deed and the consequent eradication
shortly afterwards. How they even could have done it is very unclear.

Up to this day, it is not possible to open a portal Beminum Leo or HIP
2091, the nearest projectable point laying about 1 LY away from each
star system. This had been further out immediately after the
destruction. Readings from that distance give only static in the
electromagnetic wave spectrum and an eerie cacophonic signal interwoven.
There is no sign of humans any more.

Shortly after, the Hagendorf Treaty was put into action. It empowered an
independent security organization financed by the Big 12 and the
nation-states with operational oversight and protection. This was the
birth of the Hagendorf Projector Agency or HPA. They are responsible for
technical overview and on station security, reporting to a joint board
the ruling nations and corporations have a fixed influence on.

There has not been another incident since.

## The Hyperion Crisis 2645

The new treaty was put to the test just a few years later. The projector
of a significant junction was the target of a deliberate attack with the
goal of gaining control over this important device leading into Void
Confederacy territory. The later enquiries brought plans to light that
had to be measured in months. Bribes and tactical positioning of
personnel in key positions made the grab for the generator possible,
leading to a shutdown of the device for weeks. In the initial hour of
the takeover, patrol vessels of the HPA had been shot down or disabled
after threatening to open fire.

The grab came from the Void Confederacy itself, aiming to control trade
by the Big 12 and establish an example for controlling the corps. The VC
aimed to shift the power balance in their favour, regulating movement
and therefore getting a firm grip on the trade routes. Unfortunately for
them, neither the corps nor the remaining nations stood for it, fearing
conflict centred on their lifeblood, the generators.

A coalition force composed of national forces and corporation military
was sent in the direction of the VC, the corporations shutting down
supply lines and support. At first, VC tried forcefully to re-establish
control and put their forces on high alert. Border frictions heightened
with many small-scale engagements, mostly with Corporate Forces.

In the end, it took 6 months to put the VC into its place and regain
control of the generator for the HPA. VC was made officially responsible
for the incident, and condemned to pay reparations for the damage done.

These payments are spotty to this day. Some embargoes are still in place
and tensions between the VC and the other nation states are high. The
Big 12 seemingly have been compensated, doing business as usual.

for their future success. This early triumph marked the beginning of a
journey that would see Zenith Habitation transform from a planetary
construction company into a leader in galactic terraforming and
infrastructure.

### Specialisation and Services

Zenith\'s primary claim to fame is its revolutionary terraforming
programs. Their ability to render nearly hospitable planets liveable,
especially those rich in rare resources, has not only been a
technological marvel but also a strategic masterstroke. These
terraformed planets, effectively under Zenith\'s control, have created a
new paradigm in interstellar real estate and resource management.

Moreover, Zenith\'s expertise extends to constructing infrastructure on
well-established planets. Their solutions cater to a range of
environments, from the standard urban landscapes to the most challenging
extraterrestrial conditions.

### Corporate Culture and Leadership

At the helm of Zenith is CEO Lydia Rose, a formidable figure who has
maintained her family\'s long-standing influence over the company. Under
her stewardship, Zenith has cultivated a reputation for quality and
efficiency. Despite internal boardroom feuds, largely kept away from the
public eye, Lydia\'s leadership has kept Zenith focused on its core
mission.

Zenith\'s corporate culture is marked by an aggressive protection of its
market and a pragmatic approach to business. The corporation views its
terraforming projects as not just business ventures but as the creation
of a new \"Zenith Nation,\" a bold step towards autonomy and territorial
sovereignty.

### Economic Strategies and Galactic Influence

Zenith\'s economic strategy is characterized by its drive to maintain
its elite status and expand its influence through terraforming. By
turning uninhabitable planets into valuable assets, Zenith has
diversified its portfolio and carved out a new form of national identity
within the galaxy.

Politically, Zenith remains neutral but fiercely protective of its
interests. Their claims to terraformed planets are defended with
determination, reflecting their commitment to their long-term vision of
interstellar habitation and sovereignty.

### Conclusion

Zenith Habitation stands as a testament to human ingenuity and ambition.
From building the first Martian habitats to creating habitable planets,
Zenith\'s journey is a story of overcoming astronomical odds. As they
continue to push the boundaries of what\'s possible, Zenith Habitation
not only shapes the physical landscapes of new worlds but also the
political and economic fabric of the galaxy.

# Political Bodies

The known reaches of space are divided into five major political bodies,
their subsidiaries, factions, and undercurrents are countless. In their
current state, they are in a deadlock, caught between their interests,
political infighting, and their dependency on corporate goodwill. The
main bloodline between the stars are the stellar projectors. As their
technology is controlled by major corporations, the political powers are
tethered to their will. There have been movements to gain access to the
projectors, all of them thwarted by rather decisive travel sanctions and
the Phobus Accord, a treaty about the use of the Projectors.

Much the same goes for actions against neighbouring states and military
manoeuvring. As the corps don\'t see major conflict in their best
interest it is not encouraged. There are always minor territorial shifts
and conflicts, proxy wars and raiding. In recent history, there has been
no full-scale war between political bodies and their territory.

## Haven

Haven was formed after the secession wars and the USC Council came into
effect. In the beginning, those were settlers and explorers defecting
from the SP and USC alike aiming to push further out into space. They
maintained good faith with the USC providing knowledge and resources
from farther out. With the USC engaged with itself and the final sparks
of war, there was no resistance. Starting out as support organisations
between the new colonies soon there formed a political body controlling
and establishing norms for trade and conduct tailored to the needs of
outlying pockets of humanity. This later constituted as Haven, a very
open alliance joinable by adhering to the codes of conduct.

## New Frontier Alliance (NFA)

The NFA is the youngest of all political entities. Hailing mostly from
the Sol Protectorate, it constitutes itself from fledgling colonies,
free traders, explorers, and corp-controlled territories. It is pretty
much the Wild West out there, political decisions are mostly based on
contracts made for specific situations. Help is based on trust or
personal alliances between local factions.

With the corporate will to kill off the more ambitious players willing
to establish larger factions, a certain status quo has been achieved,
hanging in a carefully maintained balance. It is in the NFA that a
fortune still can be made without attracting too much scrutiny, but it
is also here that many sinister things happen out there in the darkness.

## Sol Protectorate (SP)

The Sol Protectorate dates from old times and has its roots in the now
confined space of the Sol System. Back in the time, many old Earth
political factions claimed new territories in the system. This, with no
historical claims, inevitably led to strife and war. In the end, a
conglomerate of factions managed to forge an alliance and took over
dominance in the system, enforcing their protection. From this alliance
dates the Sol Protectorate.

Over the centuries, the SP felt it their obligation to establish control
and care for human progress and well-being. Its methods became more
rigid and suppressing, later leading to the secession wars with the USC.
Up to this day, the SP is the most controlled and regimented territory
in known space.

## United Stellar Colonies (USC)

The United Stellar Colonies are the second-largest political entity in
the known territory of men. With the advent of interstellar travel, the
first expeditions and colonies were sent out into deep space, advancing
the foothold of humanity in the galaxy. In the beginning, everything had
been under the control of the Sol Protectorate. The SP forced control
over the colonies, requiring tithes and influence. This went fine in the
beginning, but with further growth came demands of self-governance. This
started the secession wars with the covert support of the big
corporations. In the end, they succeeded in securing their independence
and the establishment of a democratic system. Defeating the SP and the
neglect to gain control over the corps, on the contrary, giving them
more power finally led to their unrivalled rise.

## Void Confederacy (VC)

The Void Confederacy started out very similar to Haven, taking a turn
for the worse later on. The VC struck a deal with the Corporations to
take control of a major stellar projector connecting their region of
space with the SP. The specifics of this deal are unknown, but it seems
the VC sticks to it. Within their territory, the confederacy rules in an
autocratic style with considerable firepower in their hands. The rules
are strict, but there is enough bread and games to keep the people in
control. The corps thrive in the VC and are omnipresent.

# Technology in Abyssal

## Communication

Communication is one of the foremost technologies. It enables
coordination over long distances, enabling decision-making in real-time
and remote operating of drones and facilities. There are a myriad of
communication systems available, most of them still operating on old and
proven technology. One tech in particular has the chance to
revolutionize communications, quantum entanglement devices. These are
available and promising, their bandwidth is miserable to say the least,
as is the price tag. Let us have a look at the different technologies
and their uses.

### Communication mediums

First, we have to differentiate between the different communication
mediums and their different properties. We begin with the most common
and trusted, the radio wave.

#### Radio Waves

Radio Waves come at different frequencies and are radiated
omnidirectional from the transmitter. They fall into a frequency range
of 30Hz to 300GHz and have the ability to reflect off surfaces and
diffract around obstacles. Their speed is around the speed of light. On
planets with an atmosphere, very high frequencies can bounce off the
ionosphere, making them useful for very long-range communication. Inside
metallic installations or in subterranean environments, the range is
extremely crippled, sometimes almost to the line of sight. Radio waves
do not travel far underwater, about 20-30 m for very low frequencies.
Security is maintained by encrypting information because radio waves are
easily intercepted or jammed.

#### Laser Communication

Information transformation between two fixed points can be established
be laser aka tight beams. Very high bandwidths can be achieved, and the
connection is only two directional. Interception of a laser link is
almost impossible. Typically, the communication is encrypted to provide
an additional layer of security. Laser links cannot be established
underwater.

#### Microwave

The microwave lies somewhere between radio waves and laser
communication. They are typically used to connect satellites with the
surface. They can carry more bandwidth than standard radio waves, but
are more susceptible to environmental interference. Microwaves cannot
bend around objects as radio waves are, making them useless faster in
fixed enclosures. Their directionality is somewhat tighter than the
radio wave, but still relative broad to make them interceptable if you
are facing the general direction.

#### Acoustic waves

A special contender in communications are the acoustic waves. They are
the ones we naturally communicate with and the ones that work especially
well underwater. They ore omnidirectional and easily intercepted.
Underwater they are easily reflected and travel pretty fast with a speed
of 1.5Â km per second.

#### Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a different beast from all the other
communication forms. You basically take the particles and look at their
state. As an allegory, imagine they can turn clockwise or
counterclockwise. Now you entangle and synchronize the state. Both turn
clockwise, for example. What happens after entanglement is, if you
change the state of one particle, the other will follow suit. The
frightening part is, that this works over distance, vast ones. So, for
communication, you could exchange entangled particles embedded in a
receiver and a transmitter. Changing state in the transmitter will also
change state in the distant receiver.

### Communication devices

We can handle communication devices in a pretty fast way. All of them
are technical marvels that come in varied sizes and qualities. All of
them can either send, receive, or do both, and this is where the
important things come in. Mostly, the range depends on the power of the
signal and the sensitivity of the receiver. Both qualities go hand in
hand with the size and cost of the device. Robustness has its cost in
size and weight too. So, what can we expect from the communication
devices? This will be no exhaustive description of everything available,
we will just focus on the most essential aspects, personal communication
devices.

For personal communication devices, radio waves are the medium of
choice. A typical handheld device has a range of about 10Â km under the
open sky, around 3 km in a forest or urban environment and in a building
just inside that. In a space station, it could be just to the next
bulkhead.

For simplicities sake, the range of a man pack radio worn as a backpack
has about thrice these ranges.

If this were all, communication would be in a sorry state. This is why a
good deal of additional hardware is available in a modern communication
system. This can be the use of repeaters, portable antennas and even
more robust units portable by multiple individuals. In space stations,
there is a system called the leaky feeder, in fact, a hyped up antenna
running along corridors. A comm device can just be hooked up and
piggyback this system should one be in a hostile environment. High
security stations do not employ this technique.

We can think along the repeater way with microwave satellite links.
Using this way, a planetwide communication can be achieved with no
problem.

### Intersystem communication

Intersystem communication is a issue in the Abyssal universe. The
stellar projectors do not allow the passage of electromagnetic waves, so
intersystem communication is not possible without bodily carrying the
information through a projector hole. So a ship has to carry it through.
This is a costly endeavour, in time and money. And it means that you
have to entrust your communication to a third party if you do not happen
to own a ship yourself.

### Gameplay considerations

What does this all mean for gameplay? We can make some simple
deductions. First, in normal situations, being in a well-developed
system there are sufficient communication systems that enable comms from
almost every place. The lag can be significant, being about 4.5 hours
from Pluto to earth, roundtrip 9 hours. Much can happen in 9 hours.
Situations change in remote systems.

If you do not happen to possess a quantum entanglement device, you could
be out of luck. Establishing communication along the vast distances
within a planetary system without established relay stations to
propagate signals and signal targets is hard work for a communications
officer on a space vessel or a space station. High power directional
beams are needed to cross the gap in space.

Calling for help out of a system is almost impossible. Big corporate
facilities sometimes employ emergency ships with powered up Projectors
to make a quick getaway. But this is for the big fish only.

## Space Observations Devices and Sensors

We have discussed the possibilities of communicating over a distance,
even vast ones with different technical devices. Equally important is
the detection of objects in space, be it an asteroid, space vessels or
even missiles and torpedoes. There are many techniques to detect objects
with different strengths and weaknesses. All these devices scale their
capabilities with size, the analysis of the taken data samples almost
always done with help from automatic analysis systems, AI. Let\'s look
at the different devices.

### Optical Telescopes

Optical Telescopes can take pictures from space in a multitude of
wavelengths from infrared to the visible spectrum to ultraviolet light.
These systems can take big pictures or rasterize the visible area,
comparing new pictures to previously stored ones and identifying
changes. The more wavelengths are emitted from the object by reflection
or, for example, heat emission from the drive, the easier it is for a
telescope to pick up on that. Countermeasures and difficulties are
non-reflective surfaces, emission control and adaptive skins.

### Deep Space Radar

A deep space radar is very similar to a ground radar. It emits high
power, high-frequency waves to cover vast distances in space, probing
areas of space and picking up reflections. Similar to Optical
Telescopes, these are trained to filter out expected objects and confirm
their ongoing presence, trying to detect new contacts. The time
difference between emitting and receiving from continuing observation
can give hints on the velocity and course of the object. Countermeasures
are a low cross-section, emission control of electromagnetic waves,
absorbent surface and electronic warfare measures. Decoy deployment can
be a measure to confuse, but not to avoid detection.

### Gameplay Considerations

For Abyssal, these considerations build the background for understanding
the rule implementations in the combat section. Though it will be
handled on a simplified level, it is nice to know what\'s going on. For
ship to ship combat or stealth operations, it is vital to have an
understanding. Further down we will learn about Stellar Projectors that
can cross distances further than detection ranges. Keep that in mind.

## Stellar Projectors

In the boundless expanse of space, humanity\'s relentless pursuit of
exploration and innovation has culminated in the creation of Stellar
Projectors. These technological marvels, capable of rending the fabric
of space-time, have irrevocably altered the landscape of interstellar
travel, heralding both unprecedented opportunities and unforeseen
complications.

### Stationary Stellar Projectors

#### The Mechanics of Stellar Projectors

Engineered by the pre-eminent corporations of the Abyssal universe,
Stellar Projectors harness the principles of space-time manipulation to
forge portals of extraordinary nature. Visually, these portals are
awe-inspiring, at the centre impenetrable darkness encircled by a soft,
ghostly glow. Travel through these spatial rifts is not without its
oddities. Time dilation, a variable and elusive phenomenon, occurs
regardless of the distance traversed, subtly affecting the broader
cosmic fabric in ways not immediately perceptible to those journeying
through these corridors.

The placement and operation of Stellar Projectors is central to the
dynamics of interstellar travel. The colossal, stationary projectors,
have to be anchored in gravitational low zones such as stable Lagrange
points. Capable of targeting destinations up to 20 light-years away,
these behemoths are meticulously calibrated through advanced quantum
computation accounting for gravitational forces. Stellar Projectors can
create space-time holes with a frequency of up to every 2 hours, a
capability strongly dependent on the model. The latest projectors have
achieved this maximal frequency, forming the backbone of interstellar
commerce and exploration.

In contrast, ship-mounted projectors offer more flexible travel options
within star systems. These smaller, yet potent versions, integrated into
spacecraft, necessitate extended recharge and cooldown periods, often
spanning from several hours to days. This is the time the IRHEC needs to
charge up. Although they lack the extensive range of their larger
counterparts, their ability to navigate within systems and create
shorter, strategic jumps renders them indispensable for deep space
exploration and tactical manoeuvres.

Together, these two types of projectors weave a complex network of
routes across the stars, defining the rhythm of life and conflict in the
cosmic tapestry.

#### Safety Measures and Operational Protocols

Despite initial trepidations, incidents involving Stellar Projectors
have been remarkably rare. The most precarious element is the IRHEC
system powering the devices, yet dangers more typically stem from
sabotage or conflict rather than the technology itself. Corporations,
recognizing the vital role of these gateways in sustaining universal
trade networks, generally avoid overt hostilities, aware that
disruptions could severely impact their own economic interests.

#### Economic Ramifications and Corporate Hegemony

The Stellar Projector technology is available to the 12 big
corporations, each wielding considerable influence through their control
of these cosmic gateways. This technological dominion has revolutionized
trade and resource distribution, integrating even the most isolated
systems into the galactic economy. However, it has also fostered a
dependence among less advanced systems on these established trade
routes, creating an interesting net of interstellar economic
relationships.

#### Frontiers of Research and Prospective Developments

Research on Stellar Projectors is a relentless pursuit, currently
centred on augmenting gravitational stability for safer and more
predictable voyages. Scientists and engineers continue to unravel the
enigmas surrounding these devices, paving the way for potential
advancements that could further transform travel across the galaxy.

The Stellar Projectors stand not merely as instruments of travel but as
symbols of a new epoch. They highlight the boundless potential for
discovery while exposing the inherent perils of venturing into the
uncharted. Players navigating this universe will find their destinies
inextricably linked with these projectors, confronting challenges,
uncovering secrets, and potentially facing the consequences of tempering
with the very essence of space-time.

### Ship mounted Stellar Projectors

Ship-mounted stellar projectors have revolutionized both space travel
and the intricate dynamics of corporate warfare. They have unlocked new
realms of interstellar travel and reshaped strategic warfare and
exploration.

#### The Mechanics of Ship Projectors

Mounted on spacecraft, stellar projectors also utilize Instant Release
High-Energy Capacitors (IRHECs). A fully charged projector can execute a
jump of about 1 Lightyear. This range can vary with the model used and
the size of the ship, but is a good guess for medium-sized combat or
exploration ships. It takes about 10 minutes to power up a dormant ship
projector, critical if time is of the essence.

#### Precision and Strategy

Projection targeting requires an acute understanding of gravitational
influences, precise navigational calculations, and meticulous
calibration. In combat scenarios, the ability to execute precise jumps
is a crucial factor, often determining the outcome of confrontations.
For explorers, accuracy conserves valuable resources and significantly
reduces travel times in uncharted territories.

#### Exploring unknown gravitational environments 

Navigating unknown systems begins with a cautious, periphery-to-core
approach. This methodical process helps to avoid gravitational anomalies
that could lead to accidents or damage to the equipment. It makes the
approach very slow and somewhat easier to detect. From the periphery,
gravitational sensors can be used to feed data to the computational
systems calculating the portal target.

#### Detection and Stealth

The activation of a stellar projector is a detectable event, creating
ripples in the fabric of space-time. Understanding the baseline of
normal space-time activity is key to detecting these disturbances. In
densely travelled sectors, pinpointing specific jumps is challenging.

## Space Vessels

Space vessels are the blood of the Abyssal universe. They keep the
resources flowing and provide transportation through the boundless
expanses of space. There is almost no end to the forms and functions of
these vessels, from small hyperefficient race vessels to large deep
space mining vessels and large, lavish yachts, everything can be found
between the stars.

In the following sections, we will look at different core components of
a space vessel to understand their capabilities better.

### IRHEC---The Heart of Interstellar Travel

The Instant Release High-Energy Capacitor (IRHEC) stands as a
cornerstone of interstellar propulsion in Abyssal. This advanced
technology is crucial for powering stellar projectors, devices that
enable rapid traversal of the cosmos. IRHEC\'s capacity to store and
instantaneously release enormous energy quantities is a testament to
modern engineering. However, its volatility, especially under the duress
of combat, requires precise control and monitoring, balancing its
remarkable benefits with inherent risks.

The IRHEC is charged up with Fusion Reactors to gather the vast amounts
of energy that are required to engage the stellar projectors. Their
design enables them to release this energy in almost an instant to open
up the travel portal. This design is what makes it vulnerable to shock
and damage. Most of the IRHEC Modules can "vent" their stored energy
over some time or can be jettisoned in case of emergency.

It takes about 3 days to charge up the IRHEC to full jump capacity for a
medium-sized vessel. A jump drains an IRHEC completely regardless of the
jump distance or portal opening time. Weirdly the portal sucks all
energy.

On the other side there is a thing as not enough energy. This minimum
energy is needed to initiate a protal in the first place, independent of
range and time.

### Artificial Gravity 

Artificial gravity is an important aspect of life on space vessels. This
technology, essential for maintaining a semblance of Earth-like
conditions, allows for more familiar movement and combat tactics in the
weightlessness of space. Powered continuously, it ensures a more
comfortable and functional environment for the crew. However, its
dependence on a stable power source is a strategic consideration, as any
disruption could significantly impact life and operations aboard the
vessel.

### Kramer-PAD Drive

The Kramer-PAD Drive is the propulsion powerhouse of these interstellar
vessels. PAD stands for Particle acceleration drive. This fusion-based
system is ingeniously designed to use plasma acceleration for space
travel, setting new standards for efficiency and capability. With nearly
inexhaustible energy from the fusion reactors and cheap and easy to
store propulsion mass, it is possible to maintain high G acceleration
over a long period of time.

For longer journeys nothing beats the stellar projectors, for
manoeuvring and shorter trips near gravitation wells this drive is
irreplaceable. Clever steering of the exhaust torch through magnetic
manipulators, gentle course corrections are possible. Sharper turns need
auxiliary steering drives located along the ship\'s axis.

The drive exhaust torch is a clear giveaway for presence and direction
vector of a ship. There is no way to mask this thing. Stealth approach
on a Kramer PAD is just not possible. Even worse, the torch energy
signature can allow inference on the drive\'s manufacturer, energy
output and sometimes even the individual drive. The latter takes time
for information gathering and analysis.

#### G-Forces in Space

The Kramer-PAD drive can create strong acceleration forces. This goes
for prolonged periods of time as well as in combat manoeuvring. These
forces outweigh the generated artificial gravity fields by far. This can
have unsavoury effects on organic passengers and unsecured items. A
human being can tolerate up to 9G for seconds, 3-5G being the limit for
operations for more than a few minutes. Continuous exposure to more
than1-2 G can lead to organ or spinal damage.

The most practical concern for items is manoeuvring in high G scenarios.
Loose items would go flying, possibly harming passengers or equipment.
To counter this, many space vessels\' furniture is equipped with
electromagnets or anchored into the ground. Most things aboard a vessel
have a secure storage space or fixture points.

Usually, a manoeuvre warning is issued to lock down the vehicle and give
crew and passengers time to get to secure seating. Surprise engagements
will not provide this luxury, often wreaking havoc on a ship.

Comercial spacecraft are usualy build to withstand up to 5G, combat and
specialized vessels up to 10G. Surpassing this limit will lead to
structural damage.

### Fusion Reactor and Fuel

Each vessel is equipped with a state-of-the-art fusion reactor, an
epitome of energy efficiency and sustainability. The reactor operates on
a fuel mix of deuterium and tritium, isotopes readily obtainable from
water reserves or lunar mining operations. Tritium is usually stored as
Lithium, from which Tritium is bred In the BU or Breeder Unit of the
reactor. The fusion process is highly efficient, offering a long-term
energy solution with minimal waste, crucial for the sustainability of
extended space missions.

### Advanced Construction and Materials

The construction of these vessels showcases a blend of technological
sophistication and practical design. Utilizing advanced materials,
including various aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, the
ships are built to endure the extreme conditions of space travel. The
strategic layering of materials in the hull, including ceramic and
carbon composites, ensures durability and protection, safeguarding the
vessel and its crew from the threats of both space and enemy combatants.

### Armament and Defence Systems

The armament systems of these vessels are meticulously designed for
various tactical scenarios. Long-range missile systems offer strategic
strike capabilities, while rapid-fire gauss weapons provide effective
close-quarters defence. The addition of high-caliber gauss cannons adds
a layer of offensive might. Complementing these are an array of drones
and high-intensity lasers, enhancing the ships\' strategic and
electronic warfare capabilities. The defensive suite, including
sophisticated jamming and counter-hacking systems, ensures the vessel\'s
resilience in diverse combat situations.

### Design and Functionality

The interior design of these vessels is a careful balance between
functionality and comfort. Living quarters are designed to maximize
space efficiency while providing a comfortable environment for the crew.
Larger vessels offer additional amenities, enhancing the quality of life
during long missions. The emergency med-bay, a standard feature in all
vessels, is equipped with the latest in medical technology, ensuring the
well-being and rapid medical response for the crew.

### Crew Composition and AI Systems

Crew composition is key to the successful operation of these vessels.
Each member, from the captain to the communications specialist, plays a
vital role. The onboard AI systems act as support, aiding in various
tasks and decision-making processes. However, these AI systems are
intentionally designed with limitations in complex scenarios, ensuring
that critical decisions remain within the purview of the human crew.

### Communication Technologies

Communication is a multifaceted operation in space. The vessels are
equipped with a range of communication technologies, from traditional
radio frequencies to advanced laser tight beam communications. The
pinnacle of this technology is the use of quantum devices, enabling
instantaneous, secure communication across vast distances, a critical
feature for coordination and strategic planning in the vastness of
space. These quantum devices unfortunately only provide a very limited
bandwidth.

In the \"Abyssal\" universe, space vessels are not just modes of
transportation; they are a harmonious blend of advanced technology,
strategic design, and human endeavour. Each ship narrates its story,
reflecting its origin, the crew it shelters, and the limitless
adventures waiting in the uncharted depths of the cosmos.

### Onboard Combat

In the confines of space vessels, weapon technology strikes a balance
between firepower and safety. While high-density projectiles like
depleted uranium offer devastating force, the risk of hull breaches
makes them a calculated choice. More commonly, hard polymer projectiles
are preferred for their lower risk to ship integrity. This choice
reflects the constant interplay between offensive capability and the
inherent dangers of space combat. More on that in the Gear Section.

#### Combat Considerations

Space combat in "Abyssal" involves strategic decision-making, factoring
in the environment and available technology. Automatic shotguns reign in
close quarters, delivering chaos where precision is less critical. In
contrast, the use of vented combat vessels to prevent explosive
decompression during battles showcases a tactical adaptation unique to
space warfare.

#### Close Combat and Non-Lethal Options

In a universe where even a small breach can be fatal, close combat takes
on a new dimension. Knives and short swords are common for their
reliability and lack of risk to the ship\'s integrity. Stun guns, while
effective against unarmoured targets, prove less useful against space
suits, illustrating the technological limitations and the constant arms
race between offensive and defensive technologies.

# Playing Abyssal

If you start out to play Abyssal, it tends to be a bit overwhelming.
It\'s less about the written rules and more about the unwritten nuances.
There are all those questions about the inner workings of the Universe,
how people interact, what information is available, and millions of
other questions that arise during gameplay and can really bog down the
experience. A manuscript like this cannot possibly address all these
questions. Therefore, let\'s establish a few assumptions about the
characters in Abyssal and the role of the Suit.

## The Goal of the Game

Foremost, the goal of the game is to have fun together as a group. It\'s
crucial that everyone enjoy the gameplay within a dark, unforgiving
sci-fi horror setting, a world where doom and despair may befall the
characters created by the players. There will be triumph, too. But
perhaps not for every character.

## Role and Responsibilities of The Suit

How should the Suit go about leading the game? The Suit is responsible
for crafting the players\' experience. In this capacity, he has much
influence on the overall experience of the game, so there are some hints
to make it a bit easier.

## Supporting Player Creativity

The foundation of it all is to be a supporter of the players. If they
have good ideas, go with them. If something they want to do does not fit
in your story, do not say no; guide them to the alternatives. If they
fail, do not set up a roadblock. Try to give them alternatives to keep
the story flowing and listen to their decision making. It is best
imagined as the "Yes, but..." rule.

## Decision-Making and Consistency

To keep it all consistent, explain your decisions in a few words. During
a game session, the Suit is the final arbiter of what is possible. Try
to keep discussions out of actual gameplay. Clear it up after the
session ends or between sessions.

## Adapting to Player Choices

Do not fear to deviate from the plot you prepared for the session.
Sometimes, listening to the players, things, and plans come up that are
extremely cool and fitting. There is no harm in going with the flow;
wing it. Encourage improvisation and be prepared to alter your plans to
accommodate the evolving narrative. This approach will make each session
unique and exciting.

## Balancing Challenges

Balance the difficulty of your obstacles. Gauge your players' abilities
and adjust challenges accordingly. Offer hints or modify scenarios if
they become too difficult, but also be ready to ramp up the challenge if
players are breezing through. The key is to keep players engaged and
feeling competent without overwhelming them.

## Handling Game Knowledge and Realism

Keep in mind that this game is about corporations, espionage, and the
occult. This is something most of us will have no experience with. We
cannot even tell how a mobile phone works, let alone how a stellar
projector works. We have to go with the intent of the players; the
characters will have the knowledge of how to do it. The characters are
trained professionals in the end. A better approach is to ask players
about their goals for their characters, and then the Suit can determine
the applicable rules.

## Character Integration and Development

Aim to integrate the characters into your storyline while allowing room
for their evolution. Encourage the players to explore their characters'
motivations and desires, and incorporate these elements into the
storyline. When guiding players, offer choices rather than directives,
allowing them to shape their path within the framework you provide.

## Respecting Player Sensitivities

Another important thing to consider is respect for all the players.
Sometimes Abyssal may touch on themes not everyone is comfortable with.
Try to discuss this before your journey starts, so everyone can enjoy
the plot you come up with and feel safe. Consider discussing this
individually with players, as some may hesitate to speak in front of the
group. Another way would be anonymous votes.

In conclusion, The Suit's role in Abyssal is multifaceted and requires a
blend of creativity, empathy, and strategic thinking. By following these
practical strategies, The Suit can create a game that is not only
enjoyable and challenging, but also a memorable journey for all
involved.

# The Suits Secrets

If you are a player in the universe of Abyssal, just stop reading. A lot
of fun in an RPG comes from exploring and venturing into the darkness
without knowing what you might face. So if you take a peak, it may be a
massive spoiler.

If you are, on the other hand, the Suit, the following section might
give you some ideas for scenarios. It is also a tool that you might use
to get a feeling of what abyssal is about. The ideas listed here are by
no means all there is. It is better to think of it as the tip of the
iceberg.

The vastness of space is crawling with the unknown, and darkness lurks
behind every corner. So go on and arm yourself to give the players the
shivers.

## The Thing Between the Fabric

In the vast between the crevices of time and space, an entity resides, a
relic of primordial chaos and darkness. This force, ever-present and
potent, has influenced the fabric of spacetime since the universe\'s
inception. It is not just an embodiment of ancient evil but a
fundamental cosmic principle, balancing creation with destruction, order
with chaos, good and evil.

### Continuous Influence on Civilization

Throughout history, this entity has consistently influenced sentient
life. It is the dark whisper in the shadows, the unseen hand shaping
conflicts, empires, and revolutions. In every era, occultists and
religious figures have sensed its presence, interpreting it as the
ultimate adversary in their spiritual narratives.

### The Stellar Projectors: Catalysts of Power

The development of stellar projectors in 2367, intended for interstellar
travel, unknowingly amplifies the entity\'s influence. These devices,
manipulating spacetime, resonate with the dark energy of the entity,
strengthening its grip on the physical realm. This inadvertent synergy
between cutting-edge technology and ancient cosmic power marks a new era
of occult potency.

### Renaissance of the Occult

The entity\'s amplified presence revitalizes occult and pagan practices
across the human civilization. Rituals and spells, once considered mere
relics of superstition, suddenly manifest tangible, potent results.
Practitioners find themselves wielding unprecedented power, drawing
directly from the entity\'s awakened strength.

### Religious Upheaval and Recognition

Major world religions experience a new surge in faithful followers as
the fear of the unknown and the darkness creeps into the subconscious.
The churches themselves preach the rise of the arch-enemy and fervently
preach of a pious life. Zealots of the churches are on the move,
bringing fire and death to the so called unfaithful.

### Corporate Ambition 

Corporations, sensing opportunity, race to harness the powers of the
occult. Their actions, driven by hubris and greed, further destabilize
the cosmic balance, leading to unpredictable and often perilous
consequences. Nobody has yet established a connection to the rips in
spacetime created by the projector drives.

### Agents of Darkness

There appears to be no rhyme or rhythm to the darkness. Strange entities
enter realty by calling or by chance, taking horrific forms of all
kinds, all bent on tearing down the human psyche. It almost seems as if
they are reflections of our collective nightmares, just a mirror of the
darkness in our soul. So, yes there are things we would call Ghouls and
Demons, Undead and Monsters. What they are in truth remains hidden from
us, and that may be a blessing for us all.

### The New Cosmic Order

Until now, there is only an unease among the general population. Nobody
really believes in the occult, but in hard science. The practice of the
occult is done in secret, but it yields terrible and often
uncontrollable results. Death cults and Devil worshippers roam in the
dark corners of the galaxy looking for prey, feeding them to their
newfound dark patrons. And it is getting worse.

## Cults

### Sisterhood of the Black Tongue

The Sisterhood of the Black Tongue is one of the most influential occult
societies known. Their beliefs circle around the black man, deeply
rooted in witchcraft beliefs dating back hundreds of years to pre
technical ages. The Sisterhood calls this figure the Father. Their
current engagement has taken a darker turn, for some of the believers in
modern witchcraft, their powers have returned for real, giving them
unprecedented capabilities often not anticipated by their rivals. Most
of the members of this secret society are just humans, albeit typically
with a mind bend towards power and personal gain. The Sisterhood accepts
only women into their ranks, letting them rise only for years of devout
service and obedience.

The overall goal of the Sisterhood is surely twofold. They are devout to
the black man, a figure often believed as the devil himself. They think
their power is granted to them through their initiation rites, giving
away a part of their soul in return for their witchcraft. As mentioned
above, that has started to work in earnest for some, those considered
being blessed by darkness. These powers they are bound to use to further
the perceived will of their master.

Happily, for them, this includes amassing power for themselves and
gaining influence in positions of power. Their occult abilities
certainly help along the line. Through this they acquire resources,
money, and influence that made the Sisterhood grow over the course of
the centuries, building up a sizeable fortune to call upon.

The Sisterhood is actually organized in covens, cells if you like, that
operate independently. These are handled by a messenger, bringing the
will of the Mother to individual cells. The leader of the coven reports
back to this messenger. There is no other contact. This system really
leads up to the leader of all Sisters, the mysterious figure known to
the covens as the Mother.

The actions of the covens differ wildly. Some of them have no occult
powers at all, even if their rituals and sermons have all the bloody
tools and symbols associated with it. They go about their goals in a
more mundane way, hoping desperately for the Father to answer their
sacrifices. Others really wield the dark arts, research them and use
them as tools to dominate their enemies.

## Themes of Horror

As Abyssal goes into the realm of Horror, we have to talk a bit about
the different flavours and styles of horror. Most of the time the lines
between them blur, but it is good to think about them. Not all of them
are easy to play, as we will see later.

The more visceral ones are easiest, as they can be described using the
five senses we have. They are about the grotesque and the gory
experiences. It is the shrieks and the groaning in the dark that rattles
the nerves. Using sensory descriptions, you can go wild and create a
rich tapestry in the mind of your players.

The opposite of this happens in your mind. Paranoia and obsession, the
inner fears that surface and drive the characters to the edge. Your task
as a suit for this kind of horror is making the players insecure about
their surroundings. Why is everybody smiling at you all of a sudden? Do
they take pity on your sorry self? Maybe you can describe things that
are only in the minds of the players. Or are they not?

The vastness of space, with its inherent terror, evokes feelings of
insignificance, helplessness, and incomprehension. Confronting things
that move beyond any comprehensible logic, that care nothing for the
life and feelings of the characters and their players.

And this leads to survival. Going in, absolute sure of yourself with
high moral and being slowly worn down by the surrounding and the
strangeness will break down the players. When the time comes that the
really dark things emerge and begin to hunt, you can be sure to have the
players by their toes.

In the following sections, we will explore a few more concrete things we
can create our horror experience around. Stay tuned.

### Terrifying Experiments

In the sprawling universe of Abyssal, where corporate entities wield
immense power, a series of unethical and clandestine experiments are
conducted in the shadows. These sinister ventures, either under the
auspices of powerful conglomerates or the direction of unhinged
scientists, cross the boundaries of both science and morality.

#### Categories and Instances of Experiments

##### Hybridization of Human and Alien DNA

Secret initiatives aim to fuse human genetics with extraterrestrial
organisms, giving rise to grotesque, often tormented hybrids. Driven by
ambitions to harness alien traits or mere scientific curiosity, these
projects recklessly tamper with nature, with unpredictable consequences
once these entities are unleashed.

##### Consciousness Transfer and Creation

Explorations in transposing human consciousness into machines or other
entities, or in fabricating artificial consciousness. The ramifications
are ethically profound, frequently leaving subjects irreversibly
traumatized, estranged from themselves and often psychopathic in nature.
Whatever their nature is after undergoing this kind of treatment.

##### Enhancement of Pain Tolerance

Experiments designed to test the upper limits of human pain and
endurance thresholds, potentially for creating enhanced soldiers. The
inhumane techniques torment the mind and body of the victims, often
resulting in death, insanity, or something even more sinister. It does
not help that in this strait of research, most probands are \"willing\".

##### Neural Manipulation and Domination

Projects focused on altering or controlling the human brain, impacting
memory, behaviour, or identity. Venturing into the realms of mind
control, these experiments typically lead to a loss of self. The eerily
quiet neighbour who suddenly went on a rampage during a high-profile
event might be a chilling reminder of such experiments.

##### Experiments in Dimensional Tearing

Dangerously ambitious trials aiming to disturb the very fabric of
reality. The goal is opening gateways to unknown realms or cause
unpredictable anomalies. All this is done to get a glimpse behind the
veil. These experiments are often linked to the research on stellar
projectors.

##### Unleashing Latent Psychic Abilities

Attempts to unlock or intensify human psychic powers frequently result
in mental breakdowns, loss of control, and in recent cases, drastic
personality shifts, uncontrollable violence, and terrifying new powers
following mind-altering procedures.

##### Conclusion

These various experiments provide players, or \'Suits\', with a
multitude of narrative paths, including uncovering secrets, undertaking
daring rescue operations, navigating moral dilemmas, and facing the
nightmarish outcomes of these scientific horrors.

### Occult Experiments

In the vast, unforgiving cosmos, beneath the facade of corporate
sleekness, sinister practises are at work. Powerful corporations,
shrouded in secrecy, embark on ventures that blur the lines between
arcane mysticism and technological advancement to further their own
game. These enterprises, carried out in secluded spaces---be it on
desolate space stations or forgotten outposts---meld the ancient rites
of occultism with the forefront of technological innovation, challenging
not just principles of ethics, but the very fabric of reality.

#### Diving into the Unknown: Types and Tales of Experiments

##### Ritualistic Research

Imagine, if you will, the eerie silence of space, broken only by the
chanting of age-old spells. In this void, occult rituals come to life,
aiming to bend cosmic forces to their will or to contact things from
realms beyond our own. The outcomes maybe more than the practitioners
had hoped for.

Arcane Knowledge Digitization

Picture ancient texts and cryptic scrolls, their secrets being
translated into the binary language of the digital age. The goal is to
transfer the inherent powers of some scriptures into zeros and ones.
Stored away in impenetrable data vaults, this knowledge sits at the
crossroads of revolutionary and treacherously potent.

##### Esoteric Bio-Engineering

In the seclusion of isolated laboratories, a macabre dance of science
and sorcery takes place. Here, the goal is to forge beings of unnatural
prowess or to unearth latent human abilities. Without ethical boundaries
or respect for the known laws of nature, it is humanities take at
playing god.

##### Astral Projection Trials

Envision the quest to traverse the boundaries of physical and ethereal
planes through astral projection. A pursuit fraught with peril and the
ultimate goal of making distance irrelevant. The question remains, what
can be found beyond the gates of space and time?

##### Occult-Driven AI Development

Consider the endeavour to craft advanced AI systems guided by arcane
principles. The aim is to birth a consciousness that transcends human
understanding, a venture as awe-inspiring as it is potentially
harrowing. AI Systems capable of invoking devilish sorcery and wreaking
havoc on their creators.

#### Conclusion

For the Suits navigating the \"Abyssal\" universe, these occult
experiments open a treasure trove of narrative pathways. Imagine
venturing into the silent halls of abandoned research stations,
unearthing the remnants of dark practices, and grappling with the
aftermath of these experiments bereft of any mercy. Picture encountering
horrors born from the unholy marriage of science and the arcane, or
stumbling upon knowledge so profound it defies human logic.

Every corner of space holds secrets that dare you to uncover them, and
every one of them will challenge the limits of your courage and mind.

## Dark Rituals

### The Atrum Echo

"Out of the shadow of time I summon you, to give you life again. May you
walk again under the suns of the living and deepen our understanding
with your knowledge."

The atrum echo is a disturbing ritual to summon the soul of a dead
person. Not much is known about the special proceedings but the most
gruesome and superficial details. A human victim is used, tied to a
ritual stone and a willow semen is placed in the chest cavity through
surgery or more barbaric measures while it is still breathing. After
touching the living heart, the transformation begins. Over the next
seven days, under constant incantation of summoning chants, the semen
cannibalizes the victim until only the outer hull remains. The newborn
soul breaks out of this shell like out of a foul egg, looking and
talking like the formerly departed.

It has partial knowledge of the summoned departed, but there are
significant gaps in these memories. The demeanour changes towards
cruelness and intrigue. It will try to hide this, but will constantly
fail in doing so. This soul is by no means really the deceased the
ritual promised to bring back to live. It is more of a dark shadow,
Atrum Echo.

If left unchecked, the shadow will start to wreak havoc, sowing distrust
and paranoia, destroying the lives of the people around it.
Additionally, it will try to repeat the ritual as often as possible,
drawing more of it\'s kind into our reality.

This ritual, while a powerful tool for those seeking to exploit the
knowledge of the dead, is fraught with danger---not just for the
participants but for all of the society that might unwittingly welcome a
monster into its midst. Such rituals are sought after by the desperate
or the power-hungry, with no heed for the consequences.

### The Withering

"May corruption and death spread through your lineage, may the bloom
wither and die out of this existence into the nether.\"

The Withering has, through the ages, been a most terrible and disturbing
curse, bestowed upon the enemies of nefarious sorcerers. It destroyed
whole families clans and wiped them out of existence.

To start the curse, the first victim has to be fed with a small,
specially prepared ball of mould, tasting all wrong and foul. This mould
seeps through every pore, leaving a taste rot and decay that lingers and
can be smelled in the body odour of the victim.

He has now become contagious, but only to his blood relatives. Touching
the victim or smelling him will let the curse take hold in the newly
doomed person, starting the cycle all over again.

Once the curse progresses, rotting exanthema starts to appear that
slowly spreads across the skin of the victim. The centre of this just
dissipates into thin air as if no flesh ever existed. At the same time,
people start to forget about the victim, starting with those most
removed from it. After about two weeks, the victim has faded completely
away under agony, forgotten by all.

All blood relatives hear an eerie whisper in their minds, a whisper that
becomes more insistent the closer they are to an infected victim. It is
always on the edge, always raising doubts as to whether it really
exists. But it does, and it tells tales of death and despair, driving
the listener mad in time. The whispering stops when all the infected
victims have died and the curse has run its course.

This does not mean that there is no mention of him in medical records or
business papers. It is just that no one can put a face to the written
words any more, or remember ever speaking to the person. The victim is
effectively wiped from remembrance.

The withering curse is a terrible weapon as it spreads through the ones
you most love and wipes them from existence, even the ones that survived
and did hold you dear. But it comes at a cost for the occultist using
it. For every victim taken by the curse, a bit of life is drained,
making him weak and feeble over time. They never fully recover from
this, and it is said that their life is significantly shortened.

### Vial of bottled Darkness

To create a vile of bottled darkness the occult practioner has to
undergo painful and excrutiating procedures. In essence he harvests his
nightmares, inducing them with a vile concoction of rare herbs and
ingredients harvested from dead bodies.

After enduring these nightmares and keeping the sanity intact the
sorcerer opens puts a drop of his blood in a quartz crystal vial. This
goes on for 14 days, the final day required to be in a solar occlusion.
There are no additional requirements how to get such a thing. The final
drop fills up the vial and it is closed.

The next time anybody opens op the vial darkness is released, the
condensed nightmares come to take their victims. The darkness looks like
a night in silvery moonlight with harsh an pitchblack shadows. From
these shadows emerge the haunts, mind rending apparitions spun from
silver threads. They try to embrace and kiss their victims, tearing at
them with claw like fingers. They are diven to consume the warmth and
love and thereby destroying the sanity of those sucked and rended dry.

Luckylie the creator of the vial is save from the haunts, as is
everybody whose blood was added to the vial on creation. But they have
paid their price enduring terrible the terrible nightmares and giving
birth to the haunting terrors.

## Weapons

#### *Pistol*

Pistols offer high maneuverability and ease of concealment, making them
ideal for close-quarters combat and as secondary weapons. Their
effectiveness remains consistent in both atmospheric and vacuum
conditions. However, they face limitations in terms of range and
stopping power, especially when compared to larger firearms, and they
are generally less effective against armored targets.

#### *Submachinegun*

Submachine guns are characterized by their high rate of fire and compact
size, which makes them suitable for rapid engagements and maneuvering in
tight spaces. They are versatile in a variety of combat situations, but
their accuracy diminishes at long range, and they can be less effective
against heavily armored adversaries.

#### *Assault Rifles*

Assault rifles strike a balance between range, accuracy, and firepower,
making them versatile for both offensive and defensive roles across
different environments. The disadvantage of these rifles is their
bulkier build compared to pistols or submachine guns, rendering them
less ideal in extremely confined spaces.

#### *Sniper Rifles*

Sniper rifles are designed for high precision and stopping power,
perfect for long-range engagements and targeted eliminations. However,
they are impractical for close combat and rapid engagements, requiring a
significant level of skill and patience from the user to be effective.

#### *Longbarreled Coil Guns*

These weapons excel in terms of velocity and accuracy, particularly in
zero-gravity environments, and are capable of penetrating heavy armor.
The main drawbacks of longbarreled coil guns include their larger size
and heavier weight, necessitating more expertise for effective
operation.

#### *Grenade Launchers*

Grenade launchers in \"Abyssal\" can deliver a variety of ordnance
types, such as explosive, smoke, or gas, over distances, offering
tactical flexibility to the user. However, their effectiveness is
limited in vacuum environments, and there\'s a potential risk of
collateral damage, especially in confined spaces.

#### Shotguns (Double-Action/Automatic)

Shotguns dominate in close-quarters combat by offering a widespread and
substantial stopping power. Their main limitations are in range and
accuracy, along with a heightened risk of collateral damage, which is a
particular concern in environments where the integrity of spacecraft
hulls must be preserved.

## Ammunition

### Standard Projectile Ammunition

#### Standard rounds

The workhorse of any firearm\'s ammunition types, standard rounds are
balanced for optimum performance in a variety of conditions. They are
typically full metal jacket (FMJ) projectiles that provide reliable
penetration against soft targets. In a vacuum, they provide consistent
trajectory and impact, unaffected by atmospheric drag or gravity.
Standard rounds are the first choice for general purpose engagements,
offering a balance between stopping power and the risk of
over-penetration in space environments.

#### Armour Piercing Projectiles

Armour piercing rounds are designed to penetrate hardened targets, such
as enemy combatants wearing heavy armour or fortified structures. They
are often made from a dense, hard core material, such as tungsten or
depleted uranium, surrounded by a softer metal jacket. In the vacuum of
space, these projectiles are characterised by their high density and
momentum, allowing them to penetrate tough materials. While highly
effective against armoured opponents, their use in space combat must be
calculated to avoid catastrophic hull breaches or critical system
damage.

#### Frangible rounds

Frangible projectiles are designed to break apart on impact with hard
surfaces, minimising the risk of ricochet and over-penetration. These
projectiles are typically made from compressed metal powders that
disintegrate into powder upon impact with a solid target, transferring a
high amount of energy over a very short distance. In the vacuum of
space, where containment and collateral damage are of paramount
importance, frangible rounds offer a safer alternative for combat in and
around spacecraft. The use of frangible projectiles is particularly
common in training exercises and situations where non-lethal force is
preferred. Despite the reduced risk of hull penetration, they are still
lethal at close range against unarmoured targets, making them a
versatile choice for close-quarters combat scenarios.

#### Subsonic Rounds

Designed for stealth operations, these rounds are engineered to travel
below the speed of sound, significantly reducing the firing noise. In a
vacuum, where sound does not propagate, their advantage lies in
minimizing recoil, thus maintaining the shooter\'s position in
zero-gravity. The lower velocity reduces the risk of hull penetration.

#### Tracer Rounds

These rounds are fitted with a small pyrotechnic charge that ignites
upon firing, providing a visible trajectory. In a vacuum, the lack of
oxygen would prevent the traditional combustion-based tracer from
working, so these would use a phosphorescent material that glows upon
firing, aiding in targeting in dark space environments.

#### Incendiary Rounds

Containing a chemical compound that ignites upon impact, these rounds
are used to cause fire damage to targets. In the vacuum of space,
traditional incendiary effects are negated due to lack of oxygen;
instead, they rely on a chemical reaction to generate intense heat upon
impact, effective against sensitive equipment or for sabotage missions.

#### Chemical Rounds

These specialized rounds deliver a chemical payload upon impact, which
could range from corrosive substances to quick-hardening adhesives. In
vacuum, their utility is more specialized, such as deploying adhesives
to disable machinery or seal minor breaches temporarily.

### Shotgun Ammunition

#### Buckshot

Traditional lead or steel pellets that spread upon firing, offering a
wide damage radius. In a vacuum, the lack of air resistance allows the
pellets to maintain velocity over a longer distance, but spread is
unaffected. Suitable for close-range engagements but poses a high risk
of hull penetration.

#### Slug Rounds

A single, large projectile designed for increased accuracy and impact at
longer ranges compared to buckshot. In vacuum, slugs maintain a straight
trajectory and high impact force, making them effective for breaching
operations or against armored targets. However, they carry a significant
risk of hull breach.

#### Rubber Buckshot

Non-lethal option consisting of rubber pellets used for crowd control or
incapacitating targets without lethal force. In a vacuum, they are less
effective due to decreased impact force but are safer for use in
environments where hull integrity is a concern.

#### Flechette Shells

Contain numerous small, dart-like projectiles, providing a balance
between spread and penetration. Effective against soft targets in close
quarters; in vacuum, the darts maintain a tighter spread and longer
range. These rounds pose a moderate risk of hull penetration.

#### Gas Canister Rounds

Designed to disperse gas upon impact, useful for crowd control or
creating a localized area of denial. In a vacuum, these rounds would
deploy a quick-expanding gas that forms a cloud in a zero-gravity
environment, potentially disorienting or incapacitating targets within a
confined space.

# Rules

## Dice Mechanics

The most commonly seen dice is the six-sided one. But there are others.
The ones additionally used in the Abyssal are the four-sided and the
twenty-sided ones.

The abbreviation for six-sided dice is d6, the ones mostly used in
Abyssal follow court with d4 and d20. "d" stands for dice and the number
for the sides.

### Dice Mathematics

Before we go any further we should talk about dice and math. This is
mostly trivial but clarifies the way Abyssal writes down the operations.
After you read through this you are set and will have refreshed your
memory. Let us delve into these concepts with some examples to make them
crystal clear.

#### Simple Additions and Subtractions

##### Adding to a Roll

Imagine the game asks you to \"roll a d20 + 5\". This means you roll a
twenty-sided die (d20) and add 5 to whatever number comes up.

> *Example: You roll the d20 and it lands on 12. Add 5 to this, and your
> final tally is 17.*

##### Subtracting from a Roll

The subtraction works just as simply.

> *Example: The instruction is \"roll a d20 - 3\". Your d20 shows 15.
> Subtract 3, and you\'re left with 12.*

##### Rolling Multiple Dice

When the instructions include a number before the \'d\', like \'3d20\',
it\'s time to roll that many dice.

> *Example: For \'3d20\', roll three d20s. Let\'s say they land on 10,
> 14, and 7. The total? A hearty 31.*

#### Multiplication and Division

##### Multiplication

Roll the dice and multiply the result as directed.

> *Example: \'d6 \* 3\' means you roll a six-sided die. If it lands on
> 4, multiply that by 3 for a total of 12.*

##### Division

This follows the same principle as multiplication.

> Example: With \'d6 / 2\', rolling a 6 gets halved to 3.

#### Doubling Up

##### Doubling the Result

This simply means to double whatever you roll.

> Example: Roll a 10 on a d20, and with \"the result is doubled\", it
> escalates to 20.

##### Doubling the Dice

Here, you\'re rolling twice the number of dice than originally
instructed.

> Example: The rule says \'roll 2d6\', but \"the dice are doubled\"
> turns it into 4d6. Rolling 3, 5, 2, and 6 gives you a total of 16.

#### Dice Collection

When you encounter a notation like {3d20}, it indicates a collection of
dice where each die\'s value is considered separately. This is different
from adding up the results.

Dice collections can have names and persist over gaming sessions. The
most common one will be the Temptation dice collection.

A collection can be composed of different dice. The notation is
{3d20,3d4}. Even in this case all rolled values are considered
individually.

#### Middle Value

In Abyssal you will very often need to find the middle value of a
collection. If looking at a collection of 3 values you would take away
the highest and the lowest. The result is the remaining value. If two
dice show the same value remove one of them.

> Example: With {3d20}, you roll a 10, 15, and 7. Arrange these as 7,
> 10, 15, and the middle value, 10, is your result. If you had rolled
> 16, 16, 7 the middle value would be 16. Rolling 13, 5, 5 the middle
> value is 5

By walking through these examples, you can see how each roll is handled.
Whether you\'re adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, or playing
with dice pools, you can now do with confidence.

Remember, the essence of these rules is not just in the numbers, but in
how they bring your tabletop adventures to life. So, roll those dice
with confidence and let the story unfold!

### Checks

Playing an RPG you need a mechanic to resolve conflict, to determine if
a character has succeeded a task or if he terribly failed. These things
are resolved by rolling dice, the representatives of the fickle gods of
fate. Abyssal uses {3D20} to determine the outcome of a task.

Most tests have an active and a passive party. Someone climbing a wall
is the active part whilst the wall opposes in a passive way. These are
resolved with a simple check.

Sometimes both parts take an active role, arm wrestling being a very
obvious example. This would be an opposed check.

The third option is an ongoing check, a task that takes a certain amount
of time. In this case the check is passed after a certain amount of
tests have been passed.

#### Target Number

Target Numbers (TN) are a fundamental concept in our Dice mechanic,
acting as benchmarks for skill checks and ability tests. Essentially, a
TN is the number that a player needs to meet or exceed with their skill
check roll in order to succeed at a task or action.

Each TN is associated with a level of difficulty, from trivial tasks
that are almost always accomplished without effort, to nearly impossible
feats that only the most skilled or fortunate could achieve. The higher
the TN, the more difficult the task, and therefore, the greater the
skill or luck required to succeed.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Difficulty                  TN        Description
  --------------------------- --------- ----------------------------------
  Trivial                     0         These tasks are so easy that
                                        they\'re barely worth rolling for.
                                        They might challenge a novice but
                                        rarely anyone else.

  Easy                        2         These tasks pose a minor challenge
                                        for untrained characters but are
                                        usually straightforward for those
                                        with even a small amount of
                                        training or aptitude.

  Moderate                    6         These tasks are typically
                                        challenging for beginners but
                                        manageable for those with some
                                        experience or training.

  Difficult                   10        These tasks pose a serious
                                        challenge and often require a good
                                        amount of training or experience
                                        to succeed.

  Very difficult              14        These tasks are extremely
                                        challenging and require a high
                                        level of skill to overcome. Even
                                        those with significant training or
                                        experience can struggle with these
                                        tasks.

  Nearly impossible           16        Nearly Impossible - These tasks
                                        are at the limit of what is
                                        possible. Only those with
                                        exceptional skill and experience
                                        have any hope of succeeding.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Anatomy of a Check

So let us take a roll and establish a clear nomenclature for all the
components.

Basically we start rolling {3D20}. From this COLLECTION we choose a
VALUE. Usually it is the MIDDEL VALUE, but it can also be the HIGHEST
VALUE or lowest VALUE. Then we deduct 10 the get the ADJUSTMENT.

This adjustment is added to a SKILL VALUE or ATTRIBUTE VALUE , alongside
with applicable MODIFIERS. The resulting number is the FINAL RESULT. The
final result is then compared with a TARGET NUMBER. This will define the
OUTCOME and the LEVEL OF SUCCESS in the form of MARKS.

#### Repeating Checks

Checks will fail. Almost always the question comes up if the check can
be repeated. That is something we encounter every day, we try again and
succeed the second time. So yes, checks can be repeated. Every time a
character rolls again the TN rises by 2 and some time goes by.
Eventually the character can not make the roll succeed anymore.

The better option can not be hardcoded into the rules. It is up to the
Gamemaster to create an interesting story out of the failure and drive
the story foreward, an concept aptly named "fail foreward". This would
take out the need to reroll because a decision has been made and reason
for the check is gone.

Of course there should be a difference to a clear success. So the Suit
can cook up something devious to create a new challenging situation for
the characters that creates tension and drives the story forward.

> Example
>
> Armed with his Neural Hacking Interface, Cassian attempts to breach
> the security of a secret corporate lab hidden on a desolate asteroid.
> It\'s the dead of a cosmic night. He rolls a check to override the
> security system, but fails. The GM could allow him to try again, with
> the target number increased by two to reflect the system\'s heightened
> state of alert. Alternatively, the GM could decide the following
> Cassian succeeds in overriding the door lock, only to come face to
> face with a rogue synthetic, originally designed for maintenance, but
> now repurposed by the lab survivors as a deadly sentry. This
> unexpected encounter places Cassian in a perilous situation far beyond
> a locked door, and propels the narrative foreward.

#### Simple Check

A simple check is done by rolling {3D20} and keeping the middle value.
Everything above 10 is added to a corresponding attribute or skill,
everything below is subtracted. The result is compared to a target
number. If the result is equal to or above the target number, the check
is passed. Otherwise, it has failed.

> Example
>
> Lysara needs to navigate a turbulent fuel conduit on the abandoned
> space station Delta-9. Her skill value in \<Zero-G Navigation\> is 8,
> and the target number set by the Game Master is 10 to successfully
> traverse the fluctuating gravity and avoid the lethal energy bursts.
> She rolls a {8,17,12}. The middle of the three values is 12. She keeps
> the 12. Since 12 is 2 above the target number of 10, she adds 2 to her
> skill value of 8, totaling a final result of 10. This meets the target
> number exactly. Thus, Lysara successfully maneuvers through the
> hazardous passage

#### Opposed Checks

Sometimes two actions oppose each other, working against each other.
This could be a guard standing on watch looking out for intruders or two
people arm-wrestling. In this case, both parties roll a Simple check
without a Target Number. Both results are compared, and the higher
result wins the check. In case of a tie, the higher skill value wins the
test. If there is no winner after that, the test is repeated.

> Example
>
> Varik aims to slip undetected past a cybernetic sentinel patrolling
> the dark corridors of an interstellar trade freighter. His skill value
> in \<Stealth\> is 5, while the sentinel\'s skill in \<Surveillance\>
> is 7. Varik rolls a {10,6,15} for his stealth attempt. The middle of
> the three values is 10, which is equal to the base, so no modification
> is made to his \<Stealth\> score of 5. The sentinel, with its advanced
> detection algorithms, rolls {3,7,18} for surveillance. The middle
> value is 7, which is 3 less than the base of 10, reducing its
> effective \<Surveillance\> score to 4. With Varik\'s stealth
> outmaneuvering the sentinel\'s detection, he successfully navigates
> the shadowy passage, his silent steps a testament to the cunning
> required to survive.

#### Ongoing check

Some things take time to complete. In this case, we need an Ongoing
check. The time required per roll and the number of successes required
to complete the task define the check. The game master sets the
conditions for the check.

The notation for the check is \< target number, time per check, needed
successes \>

Each gained mark can buy one success in this case. The mark is discarded
immediately, used in such a way. The mark cannot be used to give a +1
bonus and to buy one success at the same time.

> Example
>
> Kael tries to crack an encrypted communique intercepted from a rival
> corporate faction. His skill value in \<Decryption\> is 8. The game
> master decides he requires 3 successes against a target number of 10.
> Each attempt consumes 30 minutes of tense, focused work against the
> clock.
>
> The first roll is a {9, 12, 13}, with the middle value being 12. This
> grants Kael a +2 to his \<Decryption\> value of 8, totaling a 10. This
> counts as 1 success, with 2 more needed. 30 minutes have ticked away
> in the silent hum of his workspace.
>
> For the second attempt, Kael rerolls with a {14, 19, 20} - a
> remarkable stroke of cryptographic insight. The middle value of 19
> provides a +9 bonus to his skill value, culminating in a 17. This not
> only grants him another success but also earns him 2 marks for the
> quality of his result. Realizing the urgency and nearing the
> breakthrough, Kael chooses to spend one mark to secure the final
> success, cracking the encryption wide open. Just about an hour has
> passed, and the once inscrutable message now lays bare

#### Cooperativ check

To perform a cooperative check, the main character declares their action
and the supporting character declares their assistance. The supporting
character\'s skills must be relevant to the task at hand.

The supporting character then makes a check against the same target
number -5 as the main character. If the supporting character\'s check is
successful, the target number for the main character\'s check is reduced
by 2, representing the assistance provided.

However, there are limitations. Only one character can assist at a time.

Cooperative checks are integrated into the narrative. The players
describe how the characters are working together and the impact of their
actions.

> Example
>
> Jaxon and his crewmate, Lyra, are set to decode a cryptic data matrix
> to access a sealed section of an abandoned orbital research facility.
> Jaxon\'s expertise is in \<Cryptanalysis\> with a skill value of 6,
> while Lyra is proficient in \<Data Patterns\>, holding a skill value
> of 5. The game master sets the decryption\'s target number at 15.
>
> Lyra\'s Support Roll:
>
> Lyra initiates the decryption sequence to assist Jaxon. The modified
> target number for her assistance is 15 - 5 = 10. She inputs her
> calculations {7, 12, 14} into the terminal. The algorithm stabilizes
> at the middle value of 12. This result, being 2 above 10, augments her
> skill value to a total of 7. Her aid is well-calculated and paves the
> way for Jaxon\'s attempt.
>
> Jaxon\'s Main Roll:
>
> Benefiting from Lyra\'s successful assistance, the complexity for
> Jaxon is reduced, making his new target number 13. He delves into the
> arcane symbols and abstract data structures, rolling {5, 11, 16}. The
> data coalesces at a middle value of 11. With this, he adjusts his
> \<Cryptanalysis\> approach, adding 1 to his skill value for a total of
> 7 . Despite their collaborative effort and Lyra\'s precise support, the
> result falls short of the necessary 13. The door remains sealed, its
> secrets tightly locked away.

### Temptation Dice

If you really want to succeed at a check you may choose to take the
highest instead of the middle value. The choice is made before an actual
roll.

After that roll a d4 is added to the temptation dice collection. These
d4 are called Temptation Dice.

As long as this pool has at least one dice it is rolled alongside the
{3D20} rolls. Whenever one of those d4 shows a 4 the lowest of the
{3D20} is chosen, even if fate was tempted at that roll. If any d4
resulted in a 4, one d4 will be removed from the temptation dice
collection.

Up to 4d4 can be gathered in the Temptation dice collection, after that
you can not tempt fate and take the highest dice until a slot has freed
up in the Temptation dice collection.

#### Reducing the Temptation Dice Collection

The temptation dice pool can be reduced by 1d4 by resting for an hour and passing
a successful Mind check with a TN of 5. The test is made after resting. It represents 
the character calming down and regaining focus.

### Marks

Marks are used to measure the level of success or failure that was
achieved with a check. A success earns a mark. For every full 3 that
your result surpasses the target number, another mark is gained.

Marks can also be used to activate special effects.

#### Storing Marks

Marks that are not used up in the immediate check can be stored and used
in a later check.

These stored marks can be invested before a check is made to gain a +1
bonus per Mark used. After they are invested, they are lost to the
player and have to be earned anew.

Players keep their marks until they are invested, even carrying over to
the next session.

Only 3 marks can be stored this way. A check can yield more than 3 marks and 
all of them can be used in addition to the 3 stored marks.

## Creating Character and Crew

If you want to play missions in the Universe of Abyssal you need the
main protagonists, the player characters. They are the backbone of the
story. So some special care is needed in creating them and giving them
enough background to make the stories evolving around them meaningful.
Of course, they will have some game values defining their abilities, but
that is not the most important thing. It is what ties them to reality,
what makes them care and suffer, what makes them feel success.

In the first instalment of Abyssal the game is about a corporate covert
operations team sent on missions to further the corporation\'s interest
under the radar of anyone. This does not mean that these are only
missions involving combat. There can be riddles to solve, murders to
investigate or elaborate heists to plan. But to be true, a bit of
violence is to be expected.

### The Crew

Characters in Abyssal do not act alone. They are part of a crew in the
employment of a powerful Force, usually one of the Big 12 Corporations.
Basically, every kind of organization can be this Force, given it has
the resources to grant equipment, a ship, and a home base to the
characters.

At the start of your your journey, all players and the Suit should talk
about the governing force and the crew. Either all of you agree on one,
or the Suit has prepared an employer with all the intricate backstories
for the players.

As this Employer relies upon his crew, it should be a well-honed machine
that covers a lot of mission types. So the players have to decide on
roles and Archetypes that complement each other well. This does not mean
they cannot have agendas and troubles of their own. But as the game
starts out, all of them are on the same page, more or less.

### Setting personal goals and motivations

Somewhere in their history, the characters came to work for the
corporation. And most of them voluntarily. As you already decided on the
corporation, it is time to think about why the character joined.
Certainly, this line of work yields a good pay cheque at the end of the
month. But perhaps there is more. The character may need the money to
finance his childhood dream of a space yacht. Is it revenge, to get into
the vicinity of one of the top brass of the corporation to execute
rightful wrath? Or did the character join to stay near his crush from
high school who entered into management. There are many, many goals or
ambitions a character may have, and they may well cross with the
strengths and weaknesses. That's OK, and the Suit will look at these
backgrounds and use them for the better of the overarching story.

### Create personal relations

Every character should have some personal relationships, be it a loved
one, a spouse or someone they care about somewhere. These relationships
should not tie the character down, no, they are operatives who are often
away on extended missions. These people the characters care about are
the anchors they think about and feel emotionally attached to. If the
players agree, there can also be a pre-established relationship between
two characters, making social interaction more interesting. These kinds
of relationships will also emerge during the game, you can be sure of
that.

### Character Archetypes and Backgrounds

#### Intelligence Analyst 

Strategic Insights and Covert Operations

In the realm of interstellar operations, Intelligence Analysts are
crucial, interpreting vast data to form narratives that guide mission
decisions. They excel in cryptography, signal intelligence, and data
mining. Beyond just gathering intelligence, these analysts are skilled
in psychological profiling and counter-intelligence, essential for
outmaneuvering adversaries. Their training in advanced decryption and
electronic surveillance is key in intercepting enemy communications.
Though primarily analysts, they are also equipped with defensive combat
skills and stealthy piloting abilities for critical missions.

#### Tactical Soldier

Versatile Combat Expertise

Tactical Soldiers stand as versatile forces in various combat scenarios,
including urban warfare and zero-gravity conflicts. Their expertise
spans advanced marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and experimental
weaponry, adaptable to any combat situation. These soldiers are not just
fighters; they possess skills in reconnaissance, survival, and advanced
first aid, ensuring self-sufficiency in extended missions. Their
proficiency in military vehicles and starships complements their combat
skills, while their basic stealth techniques and technological
adaptability enhance their field effectiveness.

#### Stealth Operative

The Art of Invisibility

Stealth Operatives specialize in undetected operations, skilled in
advanced stealth techniques, lock picking, and non-lethal weaponry.
Their expertise extends to disguise and mimicry, blending seamlessly
into various environments. They excel in electronic and physical
surveillance, adept at gathering intel without detection and employing
counter-surveillance to remain concealed. Despite their focus on
stealth, these operatives are proficient in self-defense and starship
piloting, emphasizing covert insertions and extractions in enemy
territories.

#### Field Engineer

Technological Backbone in Hostile Zones

Field Engineers serve as the technological backbone, with expertise in
robotics, aeronautics, and advanced computing. They play a pivotal role
in repairing and enhancing equipment, specializing in electronic warfare
to jam enemy communications and disable security systems. Their skills
extend beyond engineering; they are trained in defensive combat and can
improvise weaponry. Their adaptability shines in setting up
communication networks, establishing field bases, and providing
technical support, making them indispensable in both combat and
reconnaissance missions.

#### Medic

Advanced Medical and Combat Readiness

Medics in this interstellar setting are more than first responders; they
are experts in battlefield medicine, trauma surgery, and xenobiology,
equipped to handle diverse medical scenarios. Their training includes
combat triage, enabling quick decision-making under fire. Despite their
medical focus, Medics are skilled in defensive combat and proficient in
piloting for medical evacuations, crucial for team extraction from
high-risk zones. Additionally, their expertise in psychological first
aid maintains the team\'s mental resilience.

#### IT Specialist

Masters of Digital Warfare

IT Specialists are digital warfare experts, excelling in hacking, cyber
warfare, and artificial intelligence. They dominate in infiltrating
secure networks, extracting data, and disrupting enemy operations.
Besides their digital prowess, they are equipped with basic combat
skills and adept at using drones and remote-controlled devices for
reconnaissance. Their piloting abilities, tailored towards electronic
warfare, enable them to conduct cyber-attacks safely from their
starships, making them key players in digital battles.

#### Negotiator

Diplomatic Strategy and Conflict Resolution

Negotiators excel in diplomacy, employing skills in de-escalation and
persuasive communication. Their knowledge in cultural anthropology and
behavioral psychology allows them to navigate complex social and
political landscapes, forging alliances and resolving conflicts without
violence. Trained in self-defense and discreet piloting, they are
equipped for sensitive diplomatic missions. Their strategic influence
and psychological insight play a pivotal role in operations requiring
nuanced approaches to complex interstellar relations.

### Creating Weakness and Strength

To tie in the characters, it is important to root them in reality. If
they are highly polished people with interchangeable faces and names,
you can play through some missions and have some short-lived fun
(nothing wrong here for a single shot mission) but it will remain
without consequence. On the other hand, there can be much at stake if
the personal background of each character comes into play. There may be
a lingering drug addiction, suppressed PTSD or such fine things as a
girlfriend or wife waiting at home. Gambling debts or just crushing
loneliness dowsed in nights of party and excess, all may play a role if
the shit hits the fan. Maybe there is a fine refuge for the character in
nature where he can relax after a mission. And then his enemies seek him
out there. Give these thoughts a few moments to sink in, and you will
see why they are important eventually.

Creating these strengths and weaknesses does not mean they should create
a crippled team. The characters should form a highly performant crew
their employers trust in at the beginning of the game. They are the ones
that are trusted with classified information regarding their missions.
Not all of it of course, but a great deal of. This crew should be a
mission ready one.

### Deciding on the Attributes

Attributes serve as the foundational pillars of your character,
influencing everything from physical prowess to mental acumen. In
Abyssal there are four core attributes to consider: Force, Nimbleness,
Dedication, and Mind.

#### Attributes

Characters are defined by their attributes, which represent different
aspects of their abilities and characteristics. There are four core
attributes, divided between two physical and two mental attributes,
which are used as the foundation for the character\'s capabilities.
These core attributes are then used to determine derived attributes
which further define the character\'s abilities and limitations.

Understanding the attributes is crucial for players when creating and
developing their characters, as well as during game play when making
decisions and resolving challenges. In this section, we will provide an
overview of the core and derived attributes. With this knowledge,
players can create unique and engaging characters that fit their play
style and contribute to a dynamic and exciting game experience.

##### Core Attributes

There are four core attributes that constitute a character. These
attributes are coarse, divided between two physical and two mental
attributes. These attributes have values ranging from 4 to 8 during
character generation.

###### Force (For)

Force represents a character\'s physical strength, toughness, and
resilience. A character with high Force is capable of carrying heavy
loads, breaking through obstacles, and enduring harsh conditions. This
attribute is essential for characters who rely on melee combat or need
to perform physically demanding tasks, such as climbing or swimming.

###### Nimbleness (Nim)

Nimbleness represents a character\'s agility, speed, and flexibility. A
character with high Nimbleness is quick on their feet, able to dodge
attacks, and move with precision. This attribute is essential for
characters who rely on ranged combat or need to perform acrobatic feats,
such as jumping or balancing.

###### Dedication (Ded)

Dedication represents a character\'s concentration, focus, and mental
endurance. A character with high Dedication can maintain their focus on
a task for extended periods and resist distractions and mental fatigue.
This attribute is essential for characters who rely on casting spells or
need to perform mentally demanding tasks, such as deciphering codes or
solving puzzles.

###### Mind (Mnd)

Mind represents a character\'s intelligence and the ability to grasp
complex thought structures. A character with a high Mind is capable of
understanding intricate concepts, analyzing situations, and making
informed decisions. This attribute is essential for characters who rely
on knowledge-based skills or need to solve problems creatively.

##### Derived Attributes

Derived attributes are dependent on the core attributes.

###### Speed (Spd)

Speed is the distance a character can move during tactical combat. Speed
is based upon Nimbleness. Movement during combat is discussed in the
corresponding chapter. Speed has no influence on overland travelling
speed.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
               Nimbleness                          Speed m/s
  ------------------------------------ ----------------------------------
                  4-6                                  3

                  7-9                                  4

                  10+                                  5
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Physical Endurance (PhE)

The Physical Endurance is calculated by doubling the Force Value and
adding the Nimbleness Value and divide that by three. This is the
current maximum PhE Value a character can have. It can temporarily be
reduced due to combat, strenuous activities, and illness or poison. This
list is not comprehensive. As long as the value remains positive, no
further harm will befall the character regarding the PhE. Reaching 0 or
less will have more lasting consequences.

###### Mental Endurance (MeE)

The Mental Endurance is calculated by doubling the Dedication Value and
adding the Mind Value and divide that by three. This value represents
the current maximum MeE Value for a character. This value can be reduced
due to mind-shattering experiences, bad odds, and other sources. If the
MeE remains above zero, no further problems will arise. Zero or less is
bad news for the character.

#### Allocate Points

You have a total of 24 points to distribute among these four attributes.
Each attribute must have a minimum value of 4 and a maximum value of 8
at this stage.

### Calculate Derived Attributes

After setting your core attributes, proceed to calculate your derived
attributes like Physical Endurance, Mental Endurance, and Speed. These
are based on formulas involving your core attributes and provide
additional information about your character\'s capabilities.

### Finalize Attributes

Double-check your numbers and consider how they align with your
character\'s backstory and motivations. Make any last-minute
adjustments, and you\'re set to work on your Expertise Areas and
Specialisations.

### Deciding on Skills

Skills in Abyssal are represented by Expertise Areas. You can buy a
value within these. Further down in the hierarchy are the
Specializations, representing further training in special aspects of an
Expertise Area. Here\'s how to go about selecting and upgrading them.

#### Calculate Mastery Gate

Before diving into Expertise Areas, figure out your Mastery Gate for
each one you\'re interested in. Mastery Gate is influenced by your
attributes and represents an aptitude for a Expertise Area. The
attributes associated with a skill are listed in the in the
corresponding Area.

#### Skill Selection

Choose the skills that fit your character\'s background, role, and the
needs of your adventuring party. Do you require a diplomat, a scout, or
perhaps a jack-of-all-trades? Talk with your fellow group about this and
ensure that everything fits well. Always remember you are a curated
team, put together by your corp as a functioning unit. The chosen
archetype reflects the initial skills.

You get to distribute additional 5 Progression Points in Expertise Area
Levels. The cost for advancing an Expertise Area Level is discussed
further below under "Skill cost".

During Character Creation, skills can\'t be risen higher than their
Mastery gate. Even if an Archetype has a higher Expertise Area value. In
that case, the value offered from the Archtype is capped.

costs to advance. Remember, the cost is per skill level, so plan wisely.
As the number of skill points for Character building, this can be
modified by the Suit based on the experience the group should have for
the intended plot.

**Expertise Area Progression Cost Table**

| EAL/MG | <=4 | 5-6 | 7-8 | >=9 |

#### Choose Specialisations

You may choose two specialisations under an Expertise Area with a value
of at least 7.

#### Finalize Expertise Areas

Once you\'ve allocated your points in Expertise Areas and choosen your
Specialisations, take a step back to see how your choices integrate with
your character\'s overall concept and backstory. Make any necessary
adjustments and move on to the final steps in character and crew
creation.

### Deciding on a spacecraft and equipment

At the end of crew creation, a decision has to be made on the ship and
the equipment. The crew is not too high up on the ladder of the
corporation, so their equipment will be good and functional, not
necessarily exceptional. We are talking about the standard equipment
here, not mission specific one. It is military graded, not some junk but
not cutting edge. There is no monetary limitation, just some common
sense.

The spacecraft must be a vessel that accommodates 5--10 people, equipped
with a good Kramer PAD and an intermediate stellar projector. The
characters have to speak with their Suit about their preferences, so the
corporation will provide a suitable vessel. This is also dependent on
the kind of missions the characters are trained for. No use for a hyper
stealth torpedo vessel in a diplomatic mission with interests. So
communication is key.

## Expertise Areas

Skills in the Abyssal are grouped into Expertise Area. Below these
Expertise Areas are Specialisations. These Specialisations give the
character an advantage if the Specialisation applies to the check
required for the task at hand. Sometimes the Specialisation is a
prerequisite for being able to tackle a problem at all.

### Expertise Area

Expertise Area are a thematic approach to the skills a character may
have needed during their training and education. Since characters in
Abyssal are considered to be trained operatives, capable of facing dire
threats and missions, they have received a diverse education that gives
them a broad overview in a thematic Expertise Area. This is what a
Expertise Area represents. A technically versatile operative might
repair the group\'s ships\' air scrubbers or try to short-circuit a
simple magnetic lock. The entire Expertise Area has a value that is used
by the character during Skill Checks.

### Specialisations

Expertise Areas contain skill specialisations. These are specific
subtasks contained within the larger Expertise Area. These
specialisations can either provide a bonus to a check to which they
apply, or can be a requirement. Certain types of equipment or very
special tasks contain these perquisites in their description.
Specialisations can have different levels , Apprentice, Journeyman, and
Master.

To become a Apprentice, Journeyman ,or master you need a Expertise Area
value of 4, 8, or 12 in the Expertise Area governing the Specialisation.

For some Problems you need a certain Level in a specialisation. Each
specialisation level gives you a +2 bonus on applicable tasks. The final
arbiter of this is the Suit.

#### Custom Specialisations

For each area of expertise, the Core Book offers a number of
specialisations to develop. This is not an exhaustive list. The areas of
expertise are designed to be very broad, to allow characters to perform
a wide range of tasks, and to give them the power to succeed in their
endeavours. This means that you will be able to find many subtasks that
you could fit into specialisations. You are, of course, welcome to do so
if your campaign requires a specific specialisation. Avoid overloading
the specialisations.

### Expertise Areas and Specialisations

## Character Progression

Over the time characters will gain valuable experience. They hone their
skills and make experiences in the field, making them better fit for the
things to come.

To reflect this process the Suit may award Progression Points (PP) to
the players. These can be used to buy new Expertise Area Levels (EAL) or
Specialisations.

To further Expertise Areals refer to the EAL Table to look up the cost
PP for the new EAL.. Do not forget to consider the Mastery Gate. The
possibility to unlock Specialisations come at the governing EAL. Of 4,
8, and 12. Each Specialisation Level costs 3 PP, opening up new
possibilities and boni for certain tasks.

PP will be awarded after each session, usually around 2. This may be
modified depending on various conditions. The characters my have
completed a major plot or employed very clever tactics. In that case the
award may be even higher.

A completely reasonable choice to up the award points can simply be the
time frame of sessions played. If the group only meets very two months
progression may just feel to slow.

# Combat

Combat is inevitable. At some point, characters will have no choice but
to fight for their mission objectives or simply to survive. This is
where the combat rules come into play.

As an introduction, we should formulate what these rules are about and
what they are trying to achieve. In Abyssal, combat is dramatic,
fast-paced and narrative driven by the dice rolls the players make. The
description of equipment and its abilities should play an intricate role
in suggesting possible actions. The combat rules are not intended to be
a fine-grained simulation of combat with a large number of pre-defined
rules covering all aspects.

As a Suit, you should stage combat in a dramatic way, improvising and
making it remarkable. These rules are designed to give you maximum
freedom. With this freedom comes responsibility, try to be fair and
predictable, play with the players and give them a fair warning when
things start to get hairy.

## Engagement Stakes

At the beginning of a potential battle, the Suit will call out the
potential \"stakes\" of the engagement. This is to establish the
importance of the fight to the story and the potential fallout. It is
also at this stage that the granularity of the combat is generally
defined. Since general combat skill is only one broad area of expertise,
the checks made can be tailored to a variety of outcomes. For a less
important encounter, it is perfectly feasible for the suit to ask for a
simple combat check and narrate what happens depending on the outcome of
the check.

At the other end of the spectrum is the knife fight, where the combat
checks are used to gain advantages, with the stakes being that these
advantages are small cuts, with five advantages being the fatal blow.
And each of these checks lends itself to a story. On the following pages
we will discuss the bread-and-butter approach to combat, still with a
lot of freedom.

These stakes are called "Engagement Stakes".

## Time in Combat

Time in combat is fluid. From a narrative perspective, the measurement
of time is done in spotlights. The Suit has to ascertain that the
spotlights are roughly divided equally among the combatants. This fluid
approach enables slow phases in combat as parties have both taken cover
and take some time to decide what to do.

The time after each participant of the engagement had its spotlight is
called a segment.

The length of a segment can change with the actions of a combatant, as
the reaction usually starts to take up equal lengths of time.

## Order of combat

The order combatants take their spotlight is determined by a simple
check Nimbleness \<\> TN 10. The result is the place in the turn order,
the higher the faster. The time combat starts, the Suit resolves the
spotlights down from the highest to the lowest result of the Nimbleness
check. Once every combatant had its spotlight, the segment is over and a
new one starts. Sometimes the spotlight of a combatant is to wait for
something to happen. The suit can let the combatant be faster
automatically or can let him make a Nimbleness simple check to see if he
actually intercepts the "something".

## Resolving of a spotlight

### Statement of "Intent"

The player states the intent of his character. This statement has to be
within reason depending on human capabilities, description of equipment
or any additional specialities that might apply.

### Setting of "Spotlight Stakes"

The Suit reflects on the "Intent" and sets up the "Spotlight Stakes". He
either approves the feasibility of the "Intent" or modifies it with the
player in the "Yes, but..." way.

These stakes are the required check or checks and their difficulty
represented by a target number (TN). He also describes the possible
risks of failure and the rewards for success if applicable. It is
totally possible that the Suit just tells the player his intent
succedes.

Besides the examples for difficulties the TNs have labels for the reason
of being intuitive. Usually one can quickly grasp the concept of
something being easy or nearly impossible. Just name the difficulty by
label and look up the associated TN. After a time it will come
naturally.

### Execute

The last phase of resolving the spotlight is the execution of the
"Intent", rolling the appropiate checks and resolve their outcome.

## Spatial considerations

During combat, it is important to keep track of the location of
characters. There are a multitude of ways of doing this. It can stay
purely in the mind, be scribbled on a piece of paper or be mapped on a
sophisticated battle map with pretty miniatures, either analogue or
digital. This tracking is only done to support the narrative and keep
things consistent. Characters have a move range to give an estimate of
their ability to cross distances. Distances are given in descriptive
terms in the following order: "close quarter" â "near" â "middle range"
â "long range". Again, this should be intuitive.

## Intents

### Deal damage

During combat one of the most common intents is dealing damage to an
oponent with a weapon. This can be broken down into three parts.

#### Hitting a target

First, you got to hit your target. The difficulty of doing so can vary
dramatically based on any number of factors. As discussed earlier,
setting a target number for the combat check is best done on intuition,
perhaps cross-checking with a few example situations.

##### Ranged Weapon

Hitting with a ranged weapon is done with a simple Combat check. If the
check is successful, the target is hit and damage is dealt based on the
Marks achieved and the protection or resistance of the target. Marks
used to deal damage are considered to be spent.

##### Close Combat Weapon

Hitting with a close combat weapon is similar to hitting with a ranged
weapon but is done with an opposed Combat check. The winner of the check
gets to hit the loser.

##### Area of Effect Weapon

Area of-effect weapons hit everything in the covered area. A successful
Combat check places the area on the right point, marks, increasing the
effectiveness of the placement. Failure does not mean a grenade does not
land anywhere. The Suit will pick a place or act according to the
established "Spotlight stake"

Marks gained during these tests do not have to be spent on dealing
damage. They can be kept respecting the basic rules for marks and used
for other actions or enhancements.

#### Check protection or resistance

Once a hit is confirmed, the penetration of the weapon is compared to
the armour protection of the target. Marks that have been achieved can be 
spent to reduce the protection of the target.
Each mark spent reduces the penetration value by 2.
A maximum of 3 marks can be spent this way.

If the penetration surpasses the protection, armour is ignored.

Should the penetration surpass half the protection value, one mark is
deduced.

Below that, the armour completely negates any damage possibly done.

Some armour protects only partially, covering only vital parts of the
body. A skilled attacker or shooter may try to bypass the armour, having
a harder time hitting an adversary. This will increase the TN for hitting the target.
Partial armour protects from killing blows dealt by area-of-effect weapons, 
maiming can still be a dangerous and plausible outcome. 

#### Deal Damage

So, a hit is confirmed, Armour has been considered, it\'s time to get at
the meat of things. All creatures have a Physical Endurance (PhE). The
attacker can now spend the remaining Marks and the damage modifier of
the used Ammunition to reduce the PhE. At this point, PhE just
represents minor injuries or fatigue. Once the PhE reaches zero the
creature receives a serious wound.

## Injury and recovery

### Serious Wounds

A serious wound can be described as a non-lethal, hindering or
incapacitating wound.

For the player characters, this means a real blow. Everything from a
shattered bone to internal bleeding is possible.

The character continues to function and stay conscious with a successful
simple Dedication check against Target Number (TN) 5.

If this Will check is failed another check Force against TN 5
establishes if the wound is fatal instantaneous.

All existing serious wounds increase the TN of these checks by 2.

For Non-Player Characters the Suit can automatically decide upon their
death or use the opponent\'s wound track.

### Regeneration of Physical Endurance (PhE)

Physical Endurance regenerates completely after the combat situation has
been resolved. No rest has to be announced, and no material is needed.

#### Recovery from Serious Wounds

Recovery from serious wounds can be a lengthy process. With the rapid
progression of medical capabilities, there are many possibilities to get
an operative into a fighting condition again. This can be achieved by
advanced painkillers, highly effective casts capable of actively
supporting movement and microsurgery robots for effective field surgery.

After receiving medical aid in the field, an operative is considered
fully functional but with zero Physical Endurance. He cannot be prepped
up once more before he has seen proper stationary medical support, which
removes all serious injuries.

The first mark will cause another serious wound, handled like the first
one.

# Space Vessel Rules 

At their core, we can describe ships based on their technical stats,
such as attributes and derived attributes of a character. These numbers
are one thing, it is important to get a feel for the ship, especially if
it is the character\'s one provided by their Patreon. We should be
thinking about quirks, colour, internal appearance and those sorts of
things that are not reflected in the rules but are influential
nonetheless. It will further the immersion and attachment to the ship,
making it a beloved place to come back to.

But to start with, we should start to describe the facts about these
small, vulnerable bubbles of air protecting the characters from the
unrelenting vastness of space.

## Attributes of a Vessel

### Size

The size of a space vessel is calculated in GST, the Gross Space
Tonnage, historically an adaption from the GT.

One GST represents about 3 m\^3 of enclosed space, including KPAD,
IRHEC, quarters, bridge, and any other.

Most vessels are designed to provide a minimum comfort for prolonged
space travel. This is not necessarily the case for all of them, given
the need for shuttles, small cargo transfer haulers and small patrol
vessels going to anchor after a successful shift. But those are mostly
orbit bound ships.

The character\'s ship should be around the size of 1000 GST. To bring
this into perspective, it would be around 38m long and roughly 10m wide
and 8m high, being in a roughly boxy shape. That is a sizeable ship
equipped for many tasks and able to carry a punch.

### Acceleration

Acceleration is measured in G and depends on the quality and size of the
KPAD and also the mass of the vessel. An average civilian ship can pull
off continued acceleration of about 2G, while ships build for speed can
accelerate up to about 9G, with extreme modifications a little more. The
limiting factor is the human body, not built for these kinds of forces.
Up to 0.5G can be compensated by the Artificial Gravitation Generators
to still have an acceptable "down".

The possibility to constantly generate 0.3 G would make the trip to Mars
7 days on average. And about 40 days out to the Kuiper Belt.

### Structural Endurance (StE)

Structural Endurance is the current stress on the structural integrity
and functioning of the vessel. Continuous evasion manoeuvres, near
misses and high-frequency velocity changes or continuous high G
acceleration put the vessel in distress, slowly wearing it down. As long
as the Strain stays above 0, everything is fine, below that, the ship
seriously starts to take damage and fall apart.

Structural Endurance is a value between 1 and 20. A StE of 0 may be an
unfinished ship in docks, a 20 a high-tech hardened military vessel
operating to clear enemy minefields. These additionally carry armour to
the max.

### Electronic Endurance (ElE)

Software workings and sensor integrity, smooth operation of integrated
systems, is what Electronic Endurance is about. Sensor overload,
Electronic Warfare attacks and hacking attempts all put strains on
established firewalls and security measures. Too much of this can bring
those systems down and make them unreliable. This endangers the overall
functioning of the ship. As long as ElE stays above 0, the systems can
take the strain. Real damage starts to happen after that.

Electronic Endurance (ElE) has a value of 1 to 20. A ElE of 1 is a
haphazardly wired vessel IT just to get the ship to work, a 20 maybe an
exploration vessel built to withstand violent solar flares or extreme
radiation.

### Signal Rating (SiR)

This is an important consideration for combat in Space. Every space
vessel has a signature strength, representing itÂ´s emmision of energy
over a multispectral field. ItÂ´s the emmision of heat, gravimetric waves
and other electromagnetic radiation. The more of these emmisions take
place the bigger is the signature of the vessel, meassured in the
Signature Rating (SiR). This is what scanners try to detect and is
influenced by many factors. These are in general the size, the energy
emmited, and the distance to the scanner. To keep it easy the SiR is
measured as a target number (TN) that is to be met by checks made by
sensors and electronic warfare.

The basic SiR is grounded in the ships size.

## Component Attributes

Unlike an organic creature whose core is defined by birth, space vessels
derive their attributes from the components built into them. These
components can sometimes be added later, can be switched or upgraded.
This makes these attributes fluid and adaptable. There are five main
components to a vessel.

### Armour

This represents the durability and resistance of the vessel\'s hull. The
higher this value goes, the more the hull can withstand damage from
various sources. This can be weapon damage, micrometeors among other
things.

Armour is represented by deducting marks from a successful hit, thereby
reducing the damage.

### Drive

The Drive Attribute represents the ships\' acceleration. With the K-Pad
Drives, fuel is no limiting factor for continuous acceleration anymore,
giving ships enormous speeds. The limiting factor is the hull and
strengthening of the drives to cope with possible G forces putting
strain on the structure. The people inside the ship are the most
limiting factor, but pulling high G manoeuvres also leads to high
maintenance needs and costs.

Drive is given in three values, Cruise/March/Max. Up to max, all
accelerations are possible, but further rules will reference these three
values.

### Cargo

How much space does the vessel posses to transport cargo and to possibly
fit with modular and special equipment. It actually represents space to
be used as deemed fit.

### Sensors

Eyes and ears of the spaceship. Usually ships are equipped with a full
sensor package, enabling them to analyse a multitude of signals, both
passive and active. The sensors enable the operator to analyse the
surroundings of the vessel and interpret them in the needed way.

Sensor Value is represented as a modifier to the Software Check to
operate the sensors. They can be negative for crappy sensors or positive
for advanced ones. A zero is a quality of a sensor, not an indication
the vessel has no sensors. If sensors are destroyed or otherwise not
available, that is marked with an X.

## Optional Component Attributes

### Electronic Warfare (EWF)

EWF gives the vessel abilities to conduct electronic attacks against
enemy weapons and ships. These are systems to be operated by personnel
or a character with the Expertise Area \<Software\>, the Specialisation
\<Cyber Operations\> may be a perquisite for more advanced systems and
is definitely relevant to EWF.

The Value is represented as a modifier to the checks. The value can be
positive or negative, depending on the quality. A zero is a quality.

### Weapons

Under weapons the different offensive systems are filed and listed.
These can be different self porpelled munition, mines, drones, and
projectile weapons.

### Emergency Repair Systems

In case of damage to a vessel it can be equipped with emergency repair
systems. These systems are things like automatic puncture sealing,
repair drones, redundancy systems, fire controll and a multitude of
other components offering added security for the vessels inhabitants.

These systems are not without limits. They have a certain amount of
replacement parts and bots, limitis on reaction speed.

So a Emergency Repair system has three parameters.

The first is the number of StE Points it can repair bofore needing to be
refilled and maintained.

The second is the efficiency using a modifier on the needed \<Hardware\>
check. This can be positive or negative.

The third is the speed of the system, limiting the number of StE that
can be repaired in a single Check.

# Space Combat (SpCo)

During their missions, the characters will surely come into conflict in
the depths of space. They will come upon hostile vessels with ill
intent. Or they want to cause some damage themselves. The one thing that
separates personal combat from space combat or any other larger vehicle
combat is that the characters have all eggs in one bowl. If their vessel
goes down they are usually done for. An exploding IRHEC needs no rescue
operation anymore, only wreckage remains. Going to combat in space
begins well before one shot is fired. It is about reconnaissance,
planning and stealth to get an advantage against your enemy. The
characters do well to come prepared and bring their expertise to the
fight. And technical superiority does help, too. Here we consider that
the Corp provides the characters with a well-equipped vessel suited for
the tasks at hand.

## Initiating Space Combat

How does a space combat start, when do you know there are shots to be
fired? It is all about situational awareness. If you are not able to
identify a potential threat your enemy can act unnoticed. He will use
that to his full advantage, hitting you out of nowhere.

This is why scanners, tactical positioning and subterfuge play a
critical role before any shot is fired.

However, that may be, once the first salvo is launched the combat has
started in earnest.

## Combat Segments and Spotlights

Space combat unfolds in segments -- abstract units of time representing
focused periods of action. The main system to order and track time is
the spotlight, emphasizing individual crew members and their
contributions to the battle.

### Spotlights in Space Combat

AÂ SpotlightÂ is a focused moment for a player to direct their character
and their assigned role on their vessel. During their Spotlight, a
player:

-   **Declares their character\'s intent:**Â States the overall goal for
    their actions this Spotlight.

-   **Details their actions:**Â Describes the specific maneuvers,
    operations, or commands their character undertakes.

-   **Resolves checks:**Â Rolls appropriate skill checks to determine the
    success or failure of their actions, as guided by the Suit.

The Spotlight isÂ player-centric, prioritizing decision-making and
strategic input, with the vessel serving as the instrument of action.
Time within a Spotlight is fluid and narrative-driven, reflecting the
dynamic and often chaotic nature of space engagements.

#### Spotlight Order and Narrative Priority

Spotlight order in Abyssal Space Combat is determined byÂ **Narrative
Priority**, granting the Suit flexibility to manage combat flow and
heighten drama. The Suit dictates the Spotlight resolution order within
each segment based on:

-   **Dramatic Flow:**Â Prioritizing actions that create compelling
    narrative developments and heighten tension.

-   **Logical Consequence:**Â Respecting cause and effect, ensuring
    actions resolve in a sensible sequence (e.g., sensor scans before
    weapon targeting).

-   **Pacing and Balance:**Â Distributing Spotlight opportunities
    reasonably among players throughout the engagement, ensuring all
    players contribute meaningfully.

This system ensures dynamic and engaging combat, moving beyond rigid
turn structures to serve the unfolding story.

#### Player-Requested Spotlights and Intent Changes

Abyssal Space Combat values responsiveness and player agency. Players
can request aÂ **Player-Requested Spotlight**Â at any point during a
combat segment to react swiftly to developing situations or seize
tactical opportunities.

The Suit evaluates Player-Requested Spotlights using theÂ "Yes, but..."
principle. Requests are granted if narratively justified, often with the
Suit introducing complications or trade-offs to maintain balance and
realism.

Similarly, players may request toÂ alter their character\'s intentÂ for
the current combat segment if the situation changes dramatically. The
Suit, again using "Yes, but...", evaluates these Intent changes to
ensure narrative coherence.

## Intent Categories in Space Combat

Abyssal Space Combat is structured around five keyÂ **Intent
Categories**, reflecting the core functions of a vessel\'s crew in
battle. In each combat segment, players typically focus their actions
within one or more of these categories, utilizing their character's
skills and expertise. This structure is only relevant to give some
common ground for the statement of intent.

### Piloting & Ship Manoeuvring

Piloting encompasses all actions related to controlling the vessel\'s
movement, positioning, and spatial awareness. A skilled pilot is crucial
for survival, utilizing Jump Generators, Kramer-PAD Drives and
manoeuvring jets to evade enemy fire and gain tactical advantages.

### Weapons Operations

Weapons Operations focuses on deploying the vessel\'s armaments
effectively. From long-range missiles to rapid-fire gauss cannons and
point defense systems, a skilled Weapons Officer utilizes a diverse
arsenal to engage and neutralize threats.

### Sensors & Electronic Warfare (EWAR) Operations

Sensor and EWAR operations are vital for gaining and maintaining a
tactical advantage. Utilizing optical telescopes, deep space radar, and
advanced electronic warfare systems, a skilled Sensors Officer and EWAR
specialist can pierce the fog of war and cripple enemy capabilities.

### Engineering & Damage Control

Engineering and Damage Control are critical for vessel survivability.
From managing the volatile IRHEC system to conducting emergency repairs
and maintaining life support, a skilled Engineer is the bulwark against
the perils of space combat.

### Command & Coordination

Command and Coordination actions, focused on strategic decision-making,
issuing orders, and maintaining crew cohesion, remain crucial for
effective space combat, as described in the preceding section.

## Distance in space combat

Distance is a tricky thing in space combat. Precision shooting over long
distances is easier, there is no drag on self-propelled munitions. So,
the engagement range can be very high. On the other hand, it relies much
on scanners and predictive targeting, the enemy being able to dodge more
easily on long-range engagements. As with ground combat, we keep the
distances a bit more abstract defining the following. Distances are
given in descriptive terms in the following order: "close quarter" â
"near" â "middle range" â "long-range" â "extreme range". As we do not
have an intuitive feeling for range in space there is the following
definition of ranges. As there are also ranges in ground combat we will
use the abbreviation SR (Space Range).

#### Close Quarter -- SR

Those are engagements below 1.000 km. These are usually fought around
static targets like space stations or stranded ships. Speeds are usually
low.

#### Near -- SR

This range goes from 1.000 km up to 10.000 km. In this range, direct
fire weapons and short-range missiles are most effective.

#### Middle Range -- SR

Here advanced sensors, positioning and strategy come into focus. From
10.000 up to 100.000 km the domain of long-range missiles starts.

> 40,075 km is the circumference of the Earth at the equator.

#### Long Range -- SR

This covers distances from 100.000 km to 1 million km, accommodating the
vastness of space and the time it takes for weapons to reach their
targets. Combat at this range is highly dependent on long-range
detection and interception technologies. Torpedos dominate.

> Earth to Moon is about 384.000 km

####  Extreme Range -- SR 

Beyond 1,000,000 km engagements are more about strategic positioning and
the use of assets like satellites for indirect attacks or
reconnaissance, rather than direct ship-to-ship combat.

## Speed and Movement in Combat

The speed in space combat has two components that can be accounted for,
the absolute speed and the acceleration. Acceleration is set by by mass
of the vessel and the capabilities of the KPAD Drive. The absolute speed
can be vast with no resistance in deep space whatsoever, lightspeed
beeing the obvious limit. Acceleration is an interesting factor in
combination with distance if you can outrun missile weapons. Or at least
buy some time. Course changes also depend on absolute speed. As always
in Abyssal this is handled narratively without exact calculations. Just
something to keep in mind.

For those interested the formula for the turn rate is r=v\^2/a. r is the
turn radius in meters, v is the absolute velocity and a lateral
acceleration.

The facing of a space vessel is achieved with manoeuvring jets turning
it on the spot. This is used for firing weapons in arbitrary directions
regardless of the flight direction. The power of these thrusters is
usually very high on combat vessels, not so on commercial craft.

## Space Combat Engagement Stakes

As with ground combat, the suit sets up the engagement stakes. This is
what the combat is about and what is to be going down. Granularity and
purpose are set. For a more comprehensive description look up
[Engagement Stakes](#engagement-stakes)

## Intents

Intents in space combat are plans by the combatants in a space combat
for what they want to achieve. This can be very creative and should be
handled by the suit on an individual basis. But as many plans recur many
times this rulebook will provide guides and considerations how to handle
these. The following intents are by no means limiting, they just give
common ground. These intents take the crew action categories as a basis
for ordering.

### Piloting and Maneuvering

#### Using Terrain against Sensors 

If there is more than open space at the engagement site and scale a
pilot my use asteroids, structures or even small moons to improve
stealth or sensor avoidance. A \<Pilot\> check against a TN set by the
GM based on the abundance of possibilities is rolled and the achieved
marks add to the difficilty of sensor lock on.

#### Evasive Maneuvers

The pilot attempts to evade incoming fire and disrupt targeting
solutions, pushing the ship to its limits. The pilot makes
aÂ \<Pilot\>Â check, TN modified by threat, enemy skill, vessel agility,
and environment. Success raises the ship\'s EWDR by the number of marks.
The ship may undergo tremendous structural stress and take damage to the
StE.

#### Stealth Maneuvering

A vessel can attempt to minimize its detectability through careful power
management and positioning. The pilot works in concert with engineering
to reduce energy emissions while maintaining essential systems. This
approach is particularly useful when trying to avoid detection during
surveillance or approaching a target unobserved. Energy has to be
conserved where possible

The pilot makes a \<Pilot\> check against a TN modified by current
emissions and environmental conditions. Each mark achieved reduces the
ship\'s Signal Rating (SiR) by 1 for the duration of the maneuver.
Success also allows for movement that could be mistaken for normal
stellar drift or debris.

#### Jump Navigation

It may be necessary to use the ship\'s stellar projectors to gain an
advantage over the enemy in a combat situation. As the use of these
devices is highly dependent on gravitational forces, the projector must
be calibrated to calculate a target location, and in some cases a
favourable location for portal generation must be found. Or it may be an
emergency jump to get away from danger quickly. The calculations for a
successful portal with the correct destination are done with
\<Navigation/Jump Plotter\>.

### Weapons Operations

#### Deploy Weapon systems

This is the big one. Engaging in combat has a goal, disabling or killing
an enemy. To that end the characters can deploy various weapon systems
and try to deal damage to an enemy. In difference to ground combat, this
is not a physical skill anymore. Algorithms and KI do much of the work
within parameters controlled by the weapons operator of a space vessel.
These are set upon the tactical analysis and sensor data received about
the enemy. So to deploy a weapon system we need data and a tactic.

The success of an attack is based upon an Opposed \<Software\> check
against the SiR of the enemy. The marks achieved by this test can be
added to the EWAR value of the deployed weapon.

##### Check protection or resistance

If the target is hit, it is checked if the weapon has penetrated the
armour of the vessel, if any.

To do this we compare the penetration value to the armour.

If the penetration value is bigger than the armour value the weapon has
completely penetrated the armour and does full damage to the Structural
Endurance (StE)

If it is greater than half the protection value, one mark of damage is
subtracted as seen under "Doing Damage", if it is lower no damage can be
done with this kind of weapon.

If a weapon does ElE Damage physical armour can not protect against the
damage.

##### Deal Damage

After a hit is confirmed and armour is considered we check for effect on
the Structural Endurance of the vessel.

The amount of damage done to the StE is the number of marks achieved
during the check to hit the target

The weapon itself has a damage modifier that is added to the damage.
Even if the damage is reduced below 1 during this step it is always at
least 1. If the StE stays above 0 everything is working fine. This
represents several things like glancing hits, damage to secondary
systems and general strain on the structure.

If the StE drops below 0 critical hits are suffered.

##### Critical Hits

When a ship suffers a critical hit, its crew must make a choice. They
can either withdraw from the battle, declaring their ship inoperable and
leaving themselves at the mercy of the enemy. Or they can choose to
fight on. In this case, the Suit decides to apply a hampering effect.
This could be the malfunction of a weapon or the loss of sensor
information. Starting with the second critical hit, if you decide to
stay in the fight, roll a D6. If the result is less than the number of
critical hits, the ship will explode in time. Also starting with the
second critical hit the Suit may completely take away fighting or
maneuvering abilities.

Critical hits on NPC ships are handled in the same way.

### Sensor & Electronic Warfare

#### EWAR against weapons

As most, if not all systems depend on sensory data to to identify,
track, and hit their target these systems can be fooled and attacked.
Once the guiding and positioning systems are out of order the weapons
are blind and will miss the target. Most weapons have an electronic
warfare attack rating or EWAR.

The targeted vessel can try an opposed check \<Software/Electronic
Warfare\> of the EW Operator against \<EWAR\> of the weapon. If the
vessel succeds then the weapon misses its target.

The ship itself and its subcomponents can have an electronic warfare
defence rating (EWDR) for passive.

#### Sensor Operations

Sensor operations in space combat are crucial for gaining battlefield
awareness, identifying threats, and enabling successful engagement
strategies. The sensor operator\'s role is to interpret and manipulate
the ship\'s sensor suite, ensuring optimal detection and targeting
capabilities. This process involves a combination of passive and active
scanning methods, balancing the need for information with the risk of
revealing the ship's position. Scanning operations can influence the
entire course of a battle by detecting enemy ships, identifying
weaknesses, and providing essential data for tactical decisions.

##### Passive Scanning

Passive scanning involves the detection and analysis of external signals
without emitting any detectable radiation or energy, keeping the vessel
hidden from enemy sensors. This method relies on the ship\'s ability to
pick up and interpret various electromagnetic waves, thermal signatures,
and other emissions from the surrounding environment.

###### Initiating Passive Scan

The sensor operator begins a passive scan by utilizing the ship's
advanced sensor arrays to sift through ambient signals. This is done
with a \<Software/Sensor Operations\> check, compared against the Signal
Rating (SiR) of any potential targets. The difficulty of this check is
influenced by the distance to the target and any environmental factors
such as nebulae or asteroid fields.

###### Outcome of Passive Scanning

Successful passive scanning provides the ship with information about the
general location, speed, and possible classification of other vessels or
objects without giving away its position. However, the information
gathered is less detailed than with active scanning. Passive scanning is
ideal for maintaining stealth while gathering critical data at longer
distances.

###### Modifiers and Considerations

Distance: The farther the target, the harder it is to gather detailed
information. Use the established Space Range (SR) categories to adjust
the TN for passive scans.

Environment: Dense asteroid fields, nebulae, or debris can both hinder
and aid passive scanning. The Suit may assign TN modifiers based on
these conditions, making scans more challenging or easier depending on
the circumstances.

##### Active Scanning

Active scanning involves emitting energy, such as radar or LIDAR pulses,
to probe the surrounding space. This method is far more precise but
comes with the risk of alerting enemies to the ship's presence and
location.

###### Initiating Active Scan

The sensor operator performs an active scan by directing the ship's
sensor systems to send out a pulse of energy and then analysing the
returned signals. This requires a \<Software/Sensor Operations\> check,
with the TN adjusted based on the ship's Signal Rating (SiR) and the
target's defensive capabilities, such as sensor jamming or stealth
technology.

###### Outcome of Active Scanning

Active scanning provides detailed information about the target,
including exact location, velocity, and potentially even identifying
weaknesses or specific systems. This level of detail is critical for
precise targeting and tactical planning. However, using active scanning
means the ship's position is likely to be revealed to any vessels within
scanning range.

###### Risk and Reward

Active scanning dramatically increases the ship's SiR, making it easier
for enemies to detect and engage. The Suit may set stakes where active
scans result in the ship being automatically detected.

##### Post-Scan Analysis

After conducting a scan, the sensor operator may perform an additional
\<Software/Sensor Operations\> check to refine the data, reducing
uncertainties or identifying patterns that might not be immediately
obvious. This can lead to bonuses on subsequent tactical or engagement
checks, depending on the clarity and accuracy of the gathered
information.

##### Interpreting Data

The data gathered from both passive and active scans must be interpreted
and relayed to the crew, influencing decisions such as weapon
deployment, maneuvering, or even retreat. The sensor operator plays a
crucial role in this process, ensuring that the information is accurate
and actionable.

##### Tactical Application

The results of scanning operations directly affect the ship\'s tactical
decisions. Detailed scans can allow the crew to exploit weaknesses,
avoid ambushes, or gain a critical advantage in positioning. Conversely,
failed or ineffective scans might leave the vessel vulnerable to
surprise attacks or strategic blunders.

### Engineering and Damage Controll

#### Emergency Repairs

Most vessels are equipped with automated repair systems enabling
prolonged survival on timeintensiv missions or in combat situations.
These systems are controlled by an operator skilled in \<Hardware\>. He
is overseeing the repair bots, priorisation and execution of damage
control. The Emergency Repair systems have a limit in how fast, how
often ond how efficient they operate. A check is done with \<Hardware\>
against a moderate difficulty (TN 6), all marks achieved may be added to
StE up to its maximum value. Check upon your optional ship attributes
for Emergency Repair Systems.

Guardian SRU

The guradian SRU (Structural Repair Unit) is able to autonomously repair
damage to the vessels systems and structure. this is achieved over a
diverse swarm of drones of various sizes that can be directed and
orchestrated by a skilled engineer. It can repair 1 StE per mark
achieved in a hardware test. This can be done every 10 minutes. A
maximum of 10 StE can be repaired before the system has to be recharged,
taking about a day to do.

#### Emergency Power Rerouting

During combat, an engineer can attempt to redirect power from
non-essential systems to boost critical ones. This involves bypassing
safety protocols and overloading power conduits to achieve temporary
performance gains. The process puts significant strain on the ship\'s
systems but can provide crucial advantages in desperate situations.

The engineer makes a \<Hardware\> check against TN 8. Each mark achieved
allows them to boost one ship system (weapons, sensors, or drives) for
one combat segment, providing a +2 bonus to checks using that system.
However, at the end of the segment, the ship takes 1 point of Electronic
Endurance (ElE) damage per boosted system as circuits and power relays
cool down.

This power boost cannot be maintained indefinitely - repeated use on the
same systems increases the TN by 2 each time until those systems have
time to fully recover.

#### System Stabilization

When ship systems are under stress from combat damage or power
fluctuations, an engineer can work to stabilize them before catastrophic
failure occurs. This involves quickly diagnosing problems and
implementing emergency protocols to prevent cascade failures.

The engineer makes a \<Hardware\> check against TN 6. Success prevents
the loss of 1 ElE or StE point (engineer\'s choice) that would otherwise
occur this segment due to system stress or damage. Additional marks can
be spent to stabilize additional points of endurance. This does not
restore lost endurance but prevents further deterioration, giving the
crew time to implement more permanent repairs.

### Command and Coordination

#### Ready vessel for combat

There are some considerations for the crew of a vessel to prepare for
combat. Most basic is the activation of the weapons protocols. This is
readying the Point Defense Weapons to react on potential threats,
activating missile targeting solutions. Nothing to sweat about.

Deeper consideration should be given to three points.

Decompression of the vessel makes it less prone to explosive
decompression after taking a major hit. All the atmosphere will be
pumped into high pressure tanks and stored. So unless these tanks take
damage there is no danger. It requires the complete crew to done
environmental suits. Some ships have the ability to to partial
decompression.

There are two sides to discharging IRHEC. On the one hand, the sheer
amount of energy in the IRHEC and its susceptibility to damage makes it
dangerous in a combat situation, sometimes leading to massive energy
discharges that wipe out most of the ship. But it also means that there
is no way to make an emergency jump using the stellar generator if the
IRHEC is empty. So it is a compromise that needs to be planned for.

Active and passive reconnaissance are necessary to gain battlefield
awareness. Systems sending out electromagnetic radiation like radar will
give away the presence and possible position, making it easier for enemy
ships to pinpoint and engage the vessel. So it is a balance between
stealth and awareness that can be taken.

## Spaceship Components

### Weaponsystems

#### Torpedos

Torpedoes are specialized munitions designed to deliver devastating
payloads over long distances. They have advanced sensor arrays to to
track their targets and initiate evasive maneuers against the target's
countermeasures. Torpedos come with Kramer PAD Drives. Often equipped
with powerful warheads, torpedoes are capable of inflicting significant
damage to enemy ships, making them a formidable weapon at long
distances. Torpedos are huge, expensive weapons.

ASAS TORPEDO

The Advanced Space Attack Solution Torpedo is a beast of a weapon.
Specializing on long and extreme ranges it has lower but longer
accelleration phase than its warhead bretheren. Equipped with a KPAD,
automated targeting logics and extensive sensory arrays it is able to
autonomosly pursue its designated target. Equiped with stealth
technology for signal masking it can stay of the radar for a long time.
Constantly accelerating with 4G it can and will outpace human maned
targets that try to run. If the ASAS hits it has terrible explosive
power

#### Medium Range missiles

Medium-range missiles are guided projectiles that can be launched from a
distance to engage targets beyond visual range. These missiles are
equipped with advanced guidance systems, allowing them to track and
intercept enemy vessels with precision.

Hades 5 Missile

Description: The Hades 5 is a standart missile in the Paladium Tactics
Corp. arsenal. It is equipped with a small Sensor array incorporationg
Thermal and Visual Reckognition, Ready to receive targeting information
from the firing vessel. Designed for medium range it packs an intense 8g
acceleration rate for 5 minutes, only being able to make inbound course
corrections and defensive maneuvers after that. This would hit a target
at 10000 km in about 10 minutes causing serious damage

#### Near Range Missiles

Near-range missiles are close-quarters weapons designed for engagements
at relatively short distances. Despite their limited range, short-range
missiles pack a powerful punch, making them ideal for rapid, close-range
combat encounters.

HYDRA INTERCEPTOR MISSILE

The Hydra is a near range defense missile usually deployed against
incomming ordenance, speak torpedos, medium range missiles or drones.
Hydra is lightweight, concentrationg on speed and relying on target
information from the firing platform. A Hydra fire solution consists of
at least 4 warheads for maximum reliability and failsafe attack
patterns. Intercept acceleration comes at 11g for 2 minutes, packing
about 2KT of explosive power.

#### Gaus Weapons

Gauss weapons utilize electromagnetic acceleration to propel projectiles
at high velocities, delivering devastating kinetic energy to enemy
targets. Known for their high rate of fire and accuracy, Gauss weapons
are favored by many for their effectiveness in combat. A second point in
favour is the relative cheap production of munitions. Gaus Weapons come
in many sizes, from long range single shot guns to Point Defence Systems
with small calibres and high rates of fire.

VULCAN GAUSS CANNON

The Vulcan Gauss Cannon is a versatile, rapid-fire weapon system.
Utilizing electromagnetic acceleration, it can fire projectiles at
extremely high velocities with pinpoint accuracy. Designed for
close-Quarter to near space engagements, the Vulcan is capable of
delivering a relentless barrage, overwhelming enemy defenses. With a
firing rate of 1200 rounds per minute, it excels in both offensive and
defensive roles, making it a staple for any well-equipped vessel.

#### Convetional Projectile Weapons

Conventional projectile weapons encompass a wide range of firearms and
cannons that use chemical propellants to launch projectiles. While not
as advanced as other weapon types, conventional projectile weapons
remain a reliable and widely used option in space combat. A big
advantage may be the highly reduced dependency from electrical power to
operate the guns, most of them equipped with local energy supplys to
move the targeting machinery.

THUNDERSTRIKE ARTILLERY

The Thunderstrike Artillery system is a robust, high-caliber
conventional cannon. Using chemical propellants, it launches heavy
projectiles capable of breaching the thickest armor. Ideal for
long-range bombardments, the Thunderstrike combines reliability with
devastating firepower. It is especially useful when electronic warfare
threatens more advanced systems, as its simple mechanics ensure
continuous operation even under heavy EMP attacks.

#### Loitering Munition

Loitering munitions are autonomous drones equipped with explosives or
other payloads, designed to loiter in a target area until a suitable
target is identified. Once engaged, these drones can rapidly engage
enemy vessels with precision strikes. Another term could be Smart Mines.

TIC SMART MINE

The TIC (Tactical Intercept Component) Smart Mine is an autonomous drone
equipped with advanced sensor arrays and explosive payloads. Designed to
loiter in designated areas, it waits patiently for enemy vessels to
enter its kill zone. Upon target acquisition, the Viper engages with
precision, delivering a powerful explosive strike. Its stealth
capabilities and long operational duration make it an excellent tool for
area denial and ambush tactics.

#### EMP Weapons

Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons are non-lethal devices that emit
electromagnetic pulses to disrupt or disable electronic systems aboard
enemy vessels. While not causing physical damage, EMP weapons can
incapacitate enemy ships and leave them vulnerable to further attacks.
They do damage to the electronic endurance.

ZEUS EMP PROJECTOR

The Zeus EMP Projector is a non-lethal weapon designed to disrupt and
disable electronic systems aboard enemy vessels. Emitting a concentrated
electromagnetic pulse, it can incapacitate vital systems, leaving ships
vulnerable to further attacks. The Zeus is particularly effective in
disabling shields, navigation systems, and weaponry without causing
physical damage, making it a strategic asset in space combat scenarios.

#### Drones

Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with various weapons and
sensors, capable of performing a wide range of tasks in space combat.
From reconnaissance and surveillance to combat and support roles, drones
are valuable assets in any fleet. They are usually deployed at
stationary or slow moving targets as they mostly lack KPAD Drives.

RAVEN RECON DRONE

The Raven Recon Drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle designed for
reconnaissance and surveillance missions. Equipped with high-resolution
cameras and advanced sensor arrays, the Raven provides real-time
intelligence and battlefield awareness. Its stealth capabilities and
long operational range allow it to operate undetected, gathering
critical data on enemy positions and movements. The Raven is an
invaluable asset for tactical planning and situational awareness.

# Terror, Fear, and Morale

During their missions, the characters may come across many mind
devastating sights and situations, shaking the core of their beliefs and
their image of the world. This could be any number of things, from the
loss of team members in gruesome ways or encountering entities not
entirely from this world. And fear is a slippery slope downward.

Each time a horrific or traumatizing event takes place, the Mind
Attribute is attacked with a Terror Value. This is an opposing check. If
the operative wins the check, he can shrug off the effects of terror. If
he loses the check, he takes the Marks as damage from his Mental
Endurance (MeE). Once the MeE hits zero, mental degradation begins.

> Example
>
> Gruber is engaged in combat with a hostile force. Shots rain down the
> corridor, keeping him and his allies in cover. Suddenly a grenade
> detonates, tearing of the arm of his nearest companion, covering him
> in blood. The Suit rules this attack him with a Terror Value (TV) of
> 8 . Gruber rolls {10, 6, 13 }, The Suit { 12, 14, 20 }. Grubers Mind
> Value is 6, the result stays at 6. Suits midle value is 14, so his
> result is TV 8 + 4, 12. The Terror achieves 1 Mark for the success and
> 2 additional marks for beeing twice time 3 above the result of Gruber
> for a total of three marks.

## Regeneration of Mental Endurance

Mental Endurance recovers once the characters reach a place of relative
safety and calm. They need to be able to rest without immediate danger
to body and soul. This can still be on mission in the theatre of
operations, but it has to be a break in the action. Once this happens,
the Mental Endurance is fully recovered.

## Mental Degradation

Mental degradation happens in small increments from 1 to 10. Each time
MeE hits zero, Mental Degradation increases by the marks that caused MeE
to hit zero.

Mental Degradation can have short-term and long-term consequences. Each
time the MeE hits 0, two random effects are determined, a short-term
effect and a long-term effect.

The short-term effect is immediately applied, decreasing the operational
value of the character. Most of these effects can and should be resolved
narratively.

The Suit can and should apply higher TNÂ´s for checks that could be
influenced by the short term effect.

Long-term effects can occur. The character rolls a Dedication against
the TN of his Mental Degradation value. If he succeeds, he can avoid
long-term effects, if not, the effect sets in, making his life miserable
and probably putting him on medication.

                     breakdown           
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Treatment of Short-Term Effects

Operatives in Abyssal are trained in applying coping strategies and
compartmentalisation. A skilled field medic can apply emergency
counselling once a situation has cooled down a bit. Each Mark that can
be achieved on a simple check in the Medical Expertise Area against a TN
equal to the Mental Degradation reduces the initial effect by that many
steps. As an example, treating Fear with 2 Marks will change it to Sleep
disturbances.

Once a mission is over, the effects will immediately become negligible
and can be removed as an entry. Narratively, they can be referenced for
a longer time.

## Treatment of long-Term effects

The reduction of long-term effects through emergency counselling works
the same way as with Short-Term effects.

The treatment of long-term effects goes hand in hand with the recovering
of mental degradation. Each month of treatment reduces the long-term
effect by one on the table. Completing the last step heals the patient.

## Drug Treatment of Effects

All the different effects can be treated with medication, psychoactive
drugs. Usually the effects settle in pretty fast, taking 1D6/2 days to
get active. Most of these dampen awareness, lead to weight gain, or can
even provoke deeper depression. Due to medical advancements these
effects are not to severe and should only start playing a role after
prolonged exposure.

## Recovering Mental Degradation

Mental Degradation can be recovered by therapy. Usualy all operative in
Abyssal have access to therapists and mental facilities during mission
downtime. With access to these 1 point of Mental Degradation can be
cured over a month.

## A Note on Mental Health

In the universe of Abyssal, we venture into extraordinary realms,
confronting horrors that stretch the imagination. As part of our
journey, we encounter various aspects of human experience, including
mental health conditions, depicted in a simplified manner for gameplay
purposes.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the stark difference between our
game\'s portrayal and the profound complexity and severity of these
conditions in real life. Mental health ailments---ranging from
depression and anxiety to PTSD and severe psychosis---are deeply serious
and multifaceted, impacting millions of people worldwide. They are not
merely obstacles to be \'cured\' with a single remedy, but rather
ongoing conditions that individuals bravely face every day, often
requiring a combination of therapy, support, and sometimes medication
over time.

We recognize that these conditions are not character flaws or signs of
weakness, but rather part of the human condition that deserves
understanding, compassion, and proper care. Our intention is not to
trivialize these experiences.

We encourage all players to approach these topics with sensitivity and
respect, and to seek professional help if you or someone you know is
struggling with mental health issues. Remember, mental health is just as
important as physical health, and there is strength in seeking support.

# The Package

The Package is a small mission taking place on the plant Lucretia V, in
the Lucretia System. But, to be true, it can be placed in any location
that fits your current campaign with almost no effort at all.

## Plot Synopsis

The characters are instructed by their employer to follow a certain
Isaac Fender to the opening of holo artist Shaun Van, where he is
showing his latest work. This opening takes place in the Vanderste Art
Gallery, a very fancy location in the city centre in a high-profile
area. Access to the Opening is by invitation only, which can be
arranged. During the event, Fender will meet Charles Dingerman and
exchange the suitcase for a card containing hard currency. Dingerman
works for a collector of occult objects. The suitcase contains the
writings of LudCrier on angels and demons, a writing that bends reality
around itself, creating sharp edges in reality that can harm people and
objects alike. It is not common, but it can be observed and be pretty
drastic. The writings are rumoured to contain formulae or rituals to
cleanse and heal disease of mind and body.

The characters\' goal is to track Dingerman, identify his destination
and, if possible, the buyer of the case, and apprehend them both. This
takes them on a chase, fending off some devil worshippers who are after
the prize and ambushing Dingerman\'s ship to get at him and his patron.

The characters are unaware of the true contents of the suitcase, which
they are told are sensitive technical writings that could fall into the
wrong hands. In reality, Fender is an employee of the characters\'
employer who stole the scriptures. The Corp has just unleashed its dogs.

## Scene 1: The Briefing

All the characters are gathered at a small little briefing room at the
local Corp. Headquarters. There are 3 rows of leather chairs and a small
podium for the speaker. Information is projected on the handheld
information pads of the characters.

They are briefed by an indistinct looking man in a grey business suit,
who introduces himself as Mr. Uhl. He informs the characters that they
are tasked with the observation and tracking of a certain Isaac Fender.
This Fender has obtained certain sensitive information from the Corp.
and intends to sell it to an undisclosed contact at the Vanderset Art
Gallery.

The gallery is about to hold an opening of the latest work of Mrs. Shaun
Van, an artist doing holographic installations. This event is invitation
only, something that has been handled, there are invitations provided
for all the characters. The invitations consist of an intricate QR,
suggesting the whole invitation handled electronically. Invitations also
double as access to the car park under the gallery.

Why an invitation only opening is chosen as the transfer point remains a
bit of a mystery.

The contact should be identified and followed. It is believed that this
contact is just an intermediary for the involved second party. In the
end, the undisclosed contact and its handler shall be apprehended,
securing the sensitive information and options to shed light on the
events that led to the stealing of the information. No information is
given to the characters about the nature of the sensitive information.
They are instructed not to inspect the information.

The characters are to prepare themselves with what they deem necessary,
do preliminary observations of the location. The opening is in 7 days.

Unknown to both the Corp and to the players, the Vanderset Art Gallery
does not only trade in the completely legal areas. They also act as
fixers for certain items, both rare or illegal, sometimes both. They
brokered the deal between fender and Dingerman. This can become clear
and proven with the apprehension of Dingerman later, or be suspected by
the characters once they witness the proceedings at the opening.

## Scene 2: The Opening 

The opening takes place at the Vanderset Gallery. It is located on the
top of a cliff on the seaside within a small and luxurious recreational
area just outside the metropole of Greytown. It is pretty cold outside,
right around freezing point. The rain of the last few days left
everything soaking wet. There is constant spray and fog rolling in from
the sea, sometimes reducing visibility to just a dozen meters.

The Gallery borders on a large plaza lined with shops and closed down
cafÃ©s waiting for warmer times. The window front belies the spaciousness
of the rooms behind, just teasing at what is to be seen inside and
protecting more precious paintings from the environmental influences
created by visitors leaving and entering the premises.

Below the building is a two-story car parking to be accessed from the
backside. There is access from the car park direct into a passage inside
the gallery building. There is also access to delivery areas for the
gallery and the building block.

The doors to the delivery area and service room are locked and secured
with a key card magnetic lock. There is a camera monitoring the area. At
the night of the opening this is closed down, during more normal hours
sometimes the backdoor is left open with a door stopper. If this is the
case, there are usually people about going after their work.

#### At the night of the opening

The gallery will be full of people, in elegant dresses with eloquent
voices. Mrs. Van's holo art is the latest and hottest topic in the local
art scene, and many people come to see that.

There is minimal security in this quiet area, just two bouncers flanking
the entrance area and two more supervising the exhibition area. The
bouncers wear thin bulletproof vests and carry telescope batons on their
belts. No more weapons are deemed important.

At the entrance area, the invitations are checked. Right behind the
entrance is a tended wardrobe for leaving the weather required wardrobe.

As this is a gallery that sells high-priced art, all rooms have
surveillance cameras installed. This goes as well for the backdoor
areas. All cameras have wired connections to the main server of the
business, located in the spacious back-office area.

The installations are installed on stellas placed inside the room, as
well as holographic pictures on the wall. The visuals are mind dazzling
to watch, the brain deciding if there is truth or just two-dimensional
space.

There are waiters and waitresses around to serve beverages and offer
fine, art friendly finger food.

At about 21.00 hours, Mrs. Van enlightens the guests with a speech about
her vision for the holo installations, something that might interest a
student of modern art. There is strong applause anyway.

#### A not so fitting guest

Observing the crowd and getting a feel for the surroundings isn't too
hard. The invitations are only in part of a personal nature, they also
include wealthy customers of the gallery as well as personal friends of
the owners. As these groups not necessarily know each other. It is
pretty easy to blend in. What they do have in common is a certain
demeanour and aura of style.

One of the guests is not fitting in very well. Yes, he wears the dress,
but he looks tense and nervous. Engaging him in a conversation can
reveal distinctive behavioural patterns marking him out, not being upper
class as the rest of the guests.

This is Iskander Deerson, member of a cult of Devil worshippers based in
the city. They have information that an item of occult importance is
being traded tonight. They are intent to intercepting it on the way back
to the city, Deerson being there to identify the buyer and the item. He
will try to tag them electronically for interception on the way back to
the city. The Devil Worshippers got the information by being tipped off
by an informant, usually working for the Vandersets. Not Deerson nor the
later interceptors are aware of this.

#### Arrival of Isaac Fender

At about 21:45 Mr. Fender arrives at the scene. He is not seen entering
the building through the front entrance, he just seems to appear. He
arrives at the main exhibition rooms through the tract leading to the
restrooms, the small kitchen and the back-office. This is due to the
fact that he has been waiting for the meeting in a small meeting room
leading to the vault of the gallery. The suitcase containing the item is
securely stored inside the vault until right before the transaction
takes place.

#### Meeting of Dingerman and Fender

Mr. Fender walks through the exhibition until he meets with Dingerman, a
man in his 30s identified by the characters as a guest, having arrived
around 19:30 hour. If they have set up outer surveillance or can gain
access to the building's security feed, they can identify the car of
Dingerman, a deep blue Ariol Thunderbird. This is a luxurious, pretty
heavy limousine. The security system of the building is not to be
confused with the one in the gallery.

Both men talk a bit, they clearly do not know each other. It is small
talk about the arrival, the weather, and the art. Listening in, the
characters can deduce that Dingerman arrived at the cities' spaceport.
After a short while, they are talked to by a waitress and start to drift
towards the back office area.

That's when Deerson makes his move. He tries to bump into Dingerman and
slip a tracker inside his jacket pocket. If he does not succeed and is
detected, a small tumult breaks out involving the bouncers. Whatever the
outcome, he has taken pictures and sent them to his accomplices before.
If a failure thwarts the interception is up to the Suit.

In any case, Fender and Dingerman enter the back-office and conclude
their deal under the supervision of Mr. Vanderset junior, who is not at
the exhibition at all. This proceeding in this room should be hidden
from the characters, if they find out, they still have to stick to the
mission briefing to track Mr. Dingerman.

#### Concluded Business

After everything is said and done, Mr. Dingerman will leave the
exhibition through the front door, take the stairs in the outer passage
to reach his car and leave the scene.

While he walks the suitcase through the exhibition hall, a tall,
handsome man suddenly clasps his eye, blood welling up through his hand,
starting to yell. This brings the party to halt. Just as silence falls
over the room, a light in the ceiling sparks out of existence, showering
some guest in glass.

If medical attention is given by the characters, they can observe that
the eye of the man and part of the skin seem to be cut, as with a razor
sharp knife. If no help is provided, the paramedics arrive shortly after
that.

## Scene 3: Intercept

Dingerman leaves the gallery in his car, directly heading to the city
spaceport. Unknown to him, an ambush is set on the road leading from the
resort to the city.

The intent is straightforward. Subduing Dingerman and securing the
suitcase after the cultist Deerson on stakeout identified him as the
target.

The plan is to provoke an accident by letting Dingerman run into the
boot of a sharply breaking car and force him to hand over the suitcase.
The first car is backed by a second car closing the distance from
behind.

First car is manned by 2 cultists, the second by three. One of the five
cultists provides heavy firepower with SMG.

At first, everything goes as planned, Dingerman is forced to run into
the lead car and even pulls over. But instead of playing their cards
right, the cultist exiting the car draws his gun before Dingerman
lowered the wind shield which is, Ariol Thunderbird standard issue, at
least partial bulletproof. Dingerman makes his move, trusts into the
wind shield protection and hits the cultist first with the door, then
with his 9Â mm hollow point in the shin. The second crew opens fire from
the second car, threatening the rear window. The Thunderbird pulls out
into the street with smoking tires.

It now lies in the hand of the characters concluding the scene. Their
objective is to enable Dingerman to meet up with his employer and not to
reveal their hand too much. It is not looking too good for him, as the
cultist pack a bit of a punch. If the characters do not intervene first,
he will lose control of his vehicle and try to escape into the woods in
the freezing cold, upping the ante for the characters. They know he will
not make it if they do not intervene. Their choice, the primary mission,
fails if Dingerman either dies or gets caught bei the cultists. The Suit
could come up with a salvage mission retrieving the book.

If they do take care of the remaining cultists, Dingerman will get his
trouble organized, getting warm clothing from the car and trying to
hitch-hike to the city. He attempts to avoid police because of the
hold-up, not out of fear. Arriving in the city, he checks in to his
hotel, the Marlin.

## Scene 4: Spacebound

The further proceedings are up to the characters. What is planned out by
Charles Dingerman is the following.

After arriving at the hotel, Dingerman initiates his emergency plan. He
packs up his things in the Marlin and either drives to the Spaceport or
calls for a taxi. The spaceport has a massive terminal building and
security around the port is pretty heavy. He deducts that he and the
package will be pretty safe here. He is absolutely correct, armed
security forces roam the area and video surveillance is just about
everywhere.

He tries to use his contacts and organize a private captain to carry him
off planet. Doing that takes him about 24 hours to organize. He also
uses this time to send out a notice to his employer and cancels the
planned transfer. Once he goes on the chartered vessel, he will have
received rendevue coordinates in space with the waiting vessel, DaoÂ´s
ship "Starspear". The transfer will be completed there after ferrying
Dingerman over.

The characters have some options here. Again, they can try to bug
Dingerman, attempting to catch his communications. They could get his
cover identity from the Marlin, this is the same he uses to look for a
private captain. Characters could use that and take this job themselves.
They could take and make him reveal contact data with his employer to
set up a new rendezvous point, making the later waste his IRHEC Power
and rendering him into a sitting duck.

## Scene 5: At Gunpoint

Dingermans Employer is Alon Dao, a filthy rich upper echelon Corp
Manager working for Quantum Technologies (or another of the Big 12 if
Quantum is the Patreon of the characters, this part of the background is
not relevant in this case). As a side hustle, he invests his money in
occult objects and texts, trying to find a spiritual cure for his
imbecile son. His love for him cost Dao his compassion for other human
beings and moral, as his hunt takes precedence above all else. Dao
arrives at the meeting point in his personal vessel, a sleek looking and
modern cruiser called the "Starspear". He is accompanied by a crew of 3,
a 4-man security detail and his son Jonathan. His affiliation with
Quantum is not openly visible.

The task of the characters is pretty clear. Apprehend Dingerman and Dao
and secure the package containing the scripture.

Depending on the prior actions of the characters, three scenarios may be
possible.

The first one has the characters tracking Dingerman and his hired vessel
to the prearranged meeting point. We got one hired, neutral vessel and
the Starspear loaded and ready to use its projector. The projector needs
about 10 minutes to power up.

The second scenario is the characters have hired themselves out to
Dingerman and arrive with him at the prearranged meeting point. Star
Spear is also ready to jump.

In the third scenario, they have been able to change the meeting point.
In this case, the Starspear has an empty IRHEC making it impossible to
jump away. This will also be true for the character's ship.

### Boarding and Ferrying

In deep space, there are different ways to get from one vessel to
another. The most basic one is just open the airlock, fly over to the
other vessel and enter it. Usually, this is done with a safety line
attached.

Second possibility are so - called soft or hard docks. It is basically
an extendible bridge spanning the distance between two airlocks. These
bridges can be made of soft, foldable materials that can cross a wider
gap but provide no real bond. The other is made of hard materials that
provide a strong connection between two vessels. These connections are
shorter and sturdier.

The third method is using shuttles, this is reserved for larger ships as
a hangar is needed.

In this scene either ferrying or docking is possible, the Starspear
supports both hard and soft docking.

### The Battle for the Starspear

Once the characters managed to enter the Starspear the gloves will be
off. It is their task to get a hold of the suitcase, Dao and in extend
Dingerman. Dao will have realized that something is very wrong and may
chat with the characters and make them an substantial offer for a
retreat. This may take place over ship intercom while his IT Officer
tries to hack into the characters comms. This is very difficult for him.

He will also bring his security detail into position to fight them off,
using deadly force. Despite carrying missiles The Starspear is no
dedicated combat vessel, itÂ´s interior quit fragile. The detail tries to
steer firefights into less critical compartmens to avoid damge to the
infrastructure.

Lighting and visibility is good, most likely the Starspear is under
artificial gravity and pressurized. Look at the plan of the starspear to
get a feel for the ship.

### Final Confrontation

The time will come the characters will pin down Dao and his son
Jonathan. Dao will try to interposition himself between the threat and
his son. He will not go down without a fight and utilize his last line
of defense, opening the Vial of bottled Darkness. Instantly the
temperature will drop and darkness decend like a night with a full moon.
From the shadows nightmarish creatures emerge clawing their ways into
the souls of all aboard the Starspear without protection, namely Dao and
his son.

The way to stop this nightmare is to knock out the conciousness of the
vials creator Mr. Dao. Killing him also does the job. If the characters
manage to get through this ordeal they have to face the question of what
to do about Jonathan if they take Dao into custody. Do they leave the
boy behind?

## Debrief

Having completed the mission the characters should return to their home
base for debriefing. They are to hand over the suitcase and the captives
Dao, Dingerman and, if aprehended, Jonathan Dao to the caring hands of
their employer.

It will be Mr. Uhl in the same little briefing room they started out
where they will be interviewed about the actions taken on the way to
acertain the mission goal.

There will be individual interviews later on regarding the circumstances
on the Starspear and in paticular the decending Darkness of the Vial.
They will also explicitly asked if they opened the suitcase and
inspected the contents. There will be reprimands if they did so.

# Dramatis Personae

## Isaac Fender

Isaac Fender is a man in his middle 40s. He is a small person which is
slightly overweight. His brittle hair starts to get lighter and is
trimmed short. His features are homely and friendly, he himself has a
high self-esteem.

His wardrobe is bleak, a bit too colourful most of the time. It is just
not high enough on his priority list to be any good. For the opening, he
is dressed in a deep blue business suit. Nothing wrong here.

He has no wife nor kids, and due to recent fluctuations and
miscalculations lost a lot of money to the financial markets. He is a
restorator in the empty of the character's Patreon.

Coming into the possession of the scriptum provided Fender with an
option. Reading it and observing the strangeness around the book, he
considered it to be a chance and organized the disappearing of it. He
does not know exactly what is written but feels it is the real deal.

He has approached the Vanderset Galery to broker a deal. The Gallery
knew of Mr. Dingermans interest in occult writing and contact was made.

## Charles Dingerman

Charles Dingerman is in his late 30s. He has a athletic physique and
stands a good height. Always tanned and well kempt and manicured he
makes an impression of a successful businessman, he is, kind of.

He always wears suit and tie, shoes and jacket of the finest sort. He is
well aware of his appearance and strives to keep it impregnable.

Charles Dingerman is a professional freelancer for shady deals of all
kinds. Outright wetwork is not his thing, he is more into transport,
acquisition and invoicing. In these jobs, he is happy and efficient.

Dingerman is always armed with a 9 mm pistol and wears a thin kevlar
vest. He has a combat knife in an ankle holster.

Dingerman was recruited to acquire the scriptum and transport it to
Mr.Dao because of the discretion and his ability to set things right
should the seller Mr. Fender have any funny ideas. Dinger knows absolute
nothing about the contents of the Package.

He has contact information for Mr.Dao, channels set up just for him. Mr.
Dao is known to him only in his unofficial position as a collector of
the occult. They both repeatedly had dealings with each other.

## Iskaander Derson

Derson is unremarkable in body and physique until he takes his clothes
off. His whole body is tattooed with occult and satanic symbology, being
deep into the cult of the "Darkest Light".

For the occasion of the opening, he has acquired half decent clothing
and avoids sticking out as a sore thumb. Usually, in the city he would
have fitted right in with the hip and wild art scene, at the retreat of
the rich, not so much.

He is a pretty ruthless person, having learned that his prayers finally
start to work. Not for him, for now, but word is spreading that there a
strange and wonderful successes, answers to prayers by devoted acolytes
of the left hand.

He is not informed why his leaders want to acquire the contents of the
suitcase, but he also understands that it is not his place to ask. He
just follows orders.

## Alon Dao

Mr. Dao is a distinguished looking man of undiscernible age. His
features hint at his Asian ancestry, being fine cut and delicate. His
skin looks like porcelain, and he has a scent of cedar wood on him. He
wears his hair bound to a ponytail with an undercut right above his
ears. The eyes are of a deep, dark brown and betray his age and sorrow.

His demeanour is always polite and reserved, stating his will and
demands in a matter-of-fact voice. He is used of getting what he wants.

He is dressed in plain black clothing of the finest cut and material,
the hem and neck trimmed with deep, dark red.

Mr. Dao has a mentally challenged son he cares deeply for. He is
convinced that the universe played a cruel trick on him as he considered
himself untouchable by dark fate during his rise through the ranks of
Quantum Nova. He has tried most treatments he considered half save and
nothing helped his son so far.

This is when he turned to spiritualism and occultism, not
differentiating between dark or light to further his goals.

He gained information about the writings of LudCrier and his book about
angels and demons and their power to elevate and heal those who can
commune with them. This is when he sends out Dingerman to find this book
and acquire it for him.

Mr. Dao is an accomplished occultist and able to summon darkness and
creatures from beyond due to his studies and the creation of a Vial of
bottled Darkness. He will hesitate to do so until he or his son are
threated personaly with bodily harm. He knows the cost and danger to
wield his powers.

## Jonathan Dao

Jonathan Dao is 24 years old. Despite his age his face always wears a
childish and surprised expression, not really comprehending what is
going on around him.

His has very short trimmed black hair and is of a very slim and tall
physique. Sometimes there is a slight drool in the corner of his mouth.
He constantly mumbles incomprehensive words, if confronted with fear he
starts a high pitched very unnerving shriek.

He wears the same expensive plain clothing as his father, grey with a
white trim on hem and arms.

Jonathan is mentally challenged from birth and has the mind of a 6 year
old. His father is absolutely convinced that his real son hides inside
and there are means to free Jonathan of his mental prison. This is no
rational thought and Alan Dao will not be convinced by actual facts.

# Items of Note

## The Scriptum

Bound in smooth, brown leather, there is just a title embossed into the
cover. It is, in fact, just called "Of Angels and Demons". There is no
print date or anything to be found, but the inside pages are printed in
a simple and common font. There is a kind of introductory text by the
author LudCrier, stating that he has found insight in the deserts of
KaTha, he has been visited by the messengers of Love and Hate and these
are the writings of their communion.

The book never feels cold to the touch, laying a hand on it lets one
feel the own pulse echoing back through the pages. It is too noticeable
to just be an illusion, but that cannot be, right? To technological
measuring this book is, it is just a book.

Trying to reveal its age is pretty easy, taking a page sample and carbon
dating it reveals an age of about 200 years. The leather of the binding
is deer leather, nothing infernal here either.

Flipping through the pages there are many drawings of angle like
creatures and the fires of hell as you would expect from the drawings of
Dante or Hironimus Bosch, interspersed with occult symbology. The book
speaks of healing and mending, and of torment for those not enlightened
above the others.

The book has some weird effects on its surroundings, creating
distortions in the fabric of spacetime. Colliding with these distortions
is like walking into a razor wire, cutting and bruising objects and
flesh alike. Usually this a faint and random effect, at random times it
also can have dramatic effects.

## The Vial of bottled Darkness

Alon Dao used an ancient ritual to bind Darkness and Nightmares into a
small vial he always wears around his neck. It looks like a quartz
crystal filled with black ink and small silver flecks. Very close
inspection will show that these specks seem to move on their own accord.

Opening the bottle has dire effects. Almost instantly, the surroundings
darken and cool down to freezing point, everything looks like bathed in
silver and oh so cold moonlight.

Then from the shadows the haunts appear, nightmares spun from silver
lights trying to embrace the living and taking their souls by kissing
and ripping. These haunts are insubstantial, the characters having no
means to directly harm them.

As Dao has fed the bottle with his nightmares, he is the source of all
this. The only way to stop the haunts and the darkness is by taking out
the consciousness of its creator, knocking him out or killing Dao will
do the trick.

The 8 Haunts attack each person on the ship except Alon and Jonathan
Dao. For each Highlight each Haunt attacks with a Terror Value of 4.

# The Starspear

An elegant looking vessel, the Starspear is a utilitarian vessel suited
for a multitude of roles. She is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment,
giving her good capabilities in portal creation, energy management and
sensory input. Packing a little bit of a punch by carrying 5 medium
range missiles, she can also fend for herself in unknown territory
exploring the darker parts of the universe.

She is almost unarmoured beyond the necessities of radiation shielding
and micrometeor protection, and her innards are susceptible to damage by
small arms fire or explosions. In critical areas like Bridge, Engine
Room and Energy Control this may lead to problems with weapons packing a
Penetration Value of 10 and up.

Communication throughout the vessel is by access points in every room
and an
