# Design Document for Space Vessel and Component Statblocks

---

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and design considerations for creating statblocks for space vessels and their components within the Abyssal TTRPG. These statblocks are intended to provide players and GMs with the necessary information to manage and utilize space vessels and their systems effectively during gameplay. The design focuses on clarity, usability, and integration with existing game mechanics.

## Statblock Structure

Each statblock is designed to present relevant information in a clear, organized manner. The structure is divided into sections for **Space Vessels** and **Components**, with each section containing specific attributes and properties.

### 1. Space Vessel Statblock

**Purpose:**  
The space vessel statblock provides a comprehensive overview of a ship's capabilities, attributes, and systems. It serves as a reference for gameplay, enabling players to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and functionality of their vessels.

**Statblock Fields:**

- **Ship Name:**  
  *The designated name or class of the vessel.*

- **Size (GST):**  
  *The Gross Space Tonnage (GST) of the vessel, representing its volume and overall size.*

- **Acceleration (Cruise/March/Max in Gs):**  
  *The vessel's acceleration capabilities, indicating its performance in different movement modes.*

- **Structural Endurance (StE):**  
  *A measure of the ship's structural integrity, with a value between 1 and 20.*

- **Electronic Endurance (ElE):**  
  *The durability of the ship's electronic systems, also measured between 1 and 20.*

- **Signal Rating (SiR):**  
  *A target number reflecting the vessel's signature strength across various detection methods.*

- **Armor:**  
  *The protective value of the ship's hull, reducing incoming damage.*

- **Cargo Capacity (GST):**  
  *The available space for cargo or modular components, measured in GST.*

- **Sensor Modifier:**  
  *A modifier applied to sensor operation checks, reflecting the quality of the ship's sensor suite.*

- **EWDR (Electronic Warfare Defense Rating):**  
  *A modifier used in defensive electronic warfare checks, indicating the ship's resilience against EW attacks.*

- **Weapon Systems:**  
  *A list of equipped weapons, each linking to their specific statblocks.*

- **Special Systems:**  
  *Any additional systems installed on the vessel, such as emergency repair units or jump navigation.*

- **Crew Complement:**  
  *The number of crew required to operate the vessel efficiently, including roles.*

- **Description:**  
  *Flavor text providing background information, special features, and narrative context for the vessel.*

### 2. Component Statblock

**Purpose:**  
Component statblocks detail the specifications and attributes of individual ship components, such as scanners, electronic warfare systems, and drives. These components are modular and can be integrated into various ships, influencing their overall performance.

**Statblock Fields:**

- **Component Name:**  
  *The name or designation of the component.*

- **Type:**  
  *The category of the component, e.g., Scanner, Drive, Electronic Warfare System.*

- **Attribute 1-4:**  
  *Specific attributes relevant to the component type, such as range modifiers, power requirements, or repair capacities.*

- **Weight:**  
  *The mass of the component, affecting the ship's overall weight and maneuverability.*

- **Power Requirement:**  
  *The energy needed to operate the component, impacting the ship's Electronic Endurance (ElE).*

- **Special Properties:**  
  *Unique effects or capabilities provided by the component, such as stealth features or increased durability.*

- **Description:**  
  *Narrative information about the component, including its design, purpose, and any notable characteristics.*

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity:**  
  The statblocks are designed to be modular, allowing easy customization and integration of different components into various ships.

- **Clarity:**  
  Information is presented in a straightforward format, ensuring that players and GMs can quickly reference and understand the attributes and capabilities of vessels and components.

- **Balance:**  
  Attributes and modifiers are balanced to maintain fairness and encourage diverse strategies in space combat and exploration.

- **Narrative Integration:**  
  Descriptions and flavor text are included to enhance immersion, providing context and background for each vessel and component.

## Next Steps

1. **Populate Statblocks:**  
   Create example statblocks for key vessels and components to test the design and identify any necessary adjustments.

2. **Playtesting:**  
   Use the statblocks in playtesting scenarios to evaluate their effectiveness and balance in actual gameplay.

3. **Refinement:**  
   Based on feedback from playtesting, refine the statblock structure and content to improve usability and ensure alignment with the overall game mechanics.

4. **Finalization:**  
   Finalize the statblock templates for inclusion in the game's rulebook and supplemental materials.
